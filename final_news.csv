0,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have eagerly anticipated the third week of April, counting down the days until a potentially crucial moment in Bitcoin’s development called “the halving.”

Essentially, the halving is a scheduled reduction in the number of new Bitcoin that go into circulation. As the supply falls, some analysts anticipate that the digital currency’s price will soar.

These reductions happen every four years or so. But this year’s halving has drawn especially enthusiastic attention as the crypto industry rebounds from years of falling prices and corporate implosions.

In recent months, Bitcoin’s price has surged to record highs, reaching $73,000 in March. Much of that increase was driven by the approval of new financial products tied to Bitcoin, which spurred billions of dollars in new investment. Crypto investors are hoping that the halving will create a similar effect, causing Bitcoin’s price to climb further.",cryptocurrency enthusiasts have eagerly anticipated the third week of april counting down the days until a potentially crucial moment in bitcoin s development called the halving essentially the halving is a scheduled reduction in the number of new bitcoin that go into circulation as the supply falls some analysts anticipate that the digital currency s price will soar these reductions happen every four years or so but this year s halving has drawn especially enthusiastic attention as the crypto industry rebounds from years of falling prices and corporate implosions in recent months bitcoin s price has surged to record highs reaching in march much of that increase was driven by the approval of new financial products tied to bitcoin which spurred billions of dollars in new investment crypto investors are hoping that the halving will create a similar effect causing bitcoin s price to climb further ,The New York Times,Technology
1,"Being an influencer can be a lot of work. Instagram thinks A.I. can lend a big hand.

Instagram is pitching popular influencers on a program that relies on artificial intelligence to interact with fans, the latest example of how Meta, Instagram’s parent company, is trying to expand the technology across its products.

The program, which is in its early stages of testing and known as “Creator A.I.,” would allow influencers to chat with fans through direct messages on the social network and potentially through Instagram comments in the future, according to five people briefed on the company’s plans. The program will essentially be a chatbot that mimics the “voice” of the Instagram influencer to respond to fans, the people said.

Most of the messages would be sent automatically and would at least initially disclose that they were A.I.-generated, according to two of the people.

The goal, according to the people, is to give creators with large followings the ability to better connect with fans while decreasing the amount of work required to personally respond to large numbers of messages and comments. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements as part of the program.",being an influencer can be a lot of work instagram thinks a i can lend a big hand instagram is pitching popular influencers on a program that relies on artificial intelligence to interact with fans the latest example of how meta instagram s parent company is trying to expand the technology across its products the program which is in its early stages of testing and known as creator a i would allow influencers to chat with fans through direct messages on the social network and potentially through instagram comments in the future according to five people briefed on the company s plans the program will essentially be a chatbot that mimics the voice of the instagram influencer to respond to fans the people said most of the messages would be sent automatically and would at least initially disclose that they were a i generated according to two of the people the goal according to the people is to give creators with large followings the ability to better connect with fans while decreasing the amount of work required to personally respond to large numbers of messages and comments the people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements as part of the program ,The New York Times,Technology
2,"The Rome boutique Chez Dede, founded in 2011 by the design duo Daria Reina and Andrea Ferolla, is filled with antiques and artworks, as well as silk-screened tote bags and limited-edition collaborations: wicker lamps created with Atelier Vime and enameled brass jewelry inspired by playing cards with the Italian jewelry designer Allegra Riva. When the penthouse apartment in the same building as the store came up for rent in 2019, the couple and their team decided to create a suite that would further bring visitors into their world. After they got city permits in early 2023, it took them about a year to renovate the two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment, now named Superattico Monserrato. They put in sliding doors, updated the kitchen with steel counters and glossy black walls and added dozens of theatrical Chez Dede touches: 17th-century carved wooden columns, a wall-size 18th-century tapestry, drawings by the 93-year-old Rome-based artist Isabella Ducrot and bed linens from their own collection. Early this year, Reina and Ferolla began renting the flat to a select few. “It’s really about sharing our lifestyle and our taste,” Reina says — and about imparting their tips for Rome: The Chez Dede team has a space at the front of the apartment, so at any point guests can stick their heads in and ask for favorite vintage shops and cafes.

3,"Japan’s public transportation is known for its punctuality, efficiency and high-quality service, which means train travel is a great way to see the countryside and to experience Japanese culture — even if you’re squeezed into Tokyo’s crowded Yamanote line at rush hour or experiencing the popular high-speed Shinkansen bullet train.

But many savvy visitors crisscross the country in another way, using luxury trains that resemble five-star hotels on rails.

Luxury rail travel appeals to “someone who wants slow travel, the experience of excellent service in a contained environment, the finest dining, the most exquisite accommodation with private bathrooms,” Simon Pielow, co-founder of the Luxury Train Club, said by phone from Wiltshire County, England. “Things that many people have no idea is possible on anything other than a royal train.”

One trip chartered by his agency starts and ends at Hakata station in the city of Fukuoka, crossing the southern Japanese island of Kyushu on the Seven Stars, a seven-car luxury sleeper train. Journeys for either two days and one night (per person, double occupancy) range from 650,000 to 900,000 yen (about $4,292 to $5,942), or four days and three nights from ¥1.2 million to ¥1.6 million.

There are no taxis, said the stationmaster, as we stood on the polished limestone floors of the high-ceilinged station, which was cool and breezy despite the brilliant late-morning sun outside. And I was the third person in two weeks to get off at Maxcanú expecting to reach Uxmal, he said.

I was midway through a five-day trip to explore the brand-new Maya Train and several of its destinations in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Designed to run 965 miles (1,554 kilometers) around a loop of 34 stations when completed, the train will whisk passengers in cool comfort through colonial cities, archaeological sites, splashy resorts and tropical forests.

Now I was stunned. Wrangling a taxi has never been a problem in Mexico. But the drivers gathered in the main square of Maxcanú offered only beat-up vans that hopscotch through small towns, where I might or might not find a taxi to Uxmal.

5,"Amy Snook knows more about wine than your average traveler. Originally from California, she now lives in the Douro Valley of Portugal, her partner works in the wine industry, and she has visited 47 countries, many of which have celebrated viticulture. But seven years ago, on a trip to Mendoza, a winemaking region in the foothills of Argentina’s Andes Mountains, she opted to abstain from drinking alcohol, a decision she would repeat in future travels.

“It’s such a long flight to Argentina, and I was only there for 10 days,” said Ms. Snook, 34, a publishing professional. “I’m aware of how alcohol affects me, and I chose to prioritize feeling amazing every day of the trip over dealing with a hangover.”

During her visit, Ms. Snook bicycled between vineyards, reveled in breathtaking scenery, relaxed with spa treatments and engaged with sommeliers and winemakers, coming away with a new appreciation for sustainable and regenerative agriculture.

“The obvious question when you tell someone that you aren’t drinking is, ‘Out of all the places you could go, why travel to wine country?’” she said. “But to me, it makes perfect sense because these regions offer all the perks of luxury travel — wellness amenities, beautiful landscapes and fine dining.”",amy snook knows more about wine than your average traveler originally from california she now lives in the douro valley of portugal her partner works in the wine industry and she has visited countries many of which have celebrated viticulture but seven years ago on a trip to mendoza a winemaking region in the foothills of argentina s andes mountains she opted to abstain from drinking alcohol a decision she would repeat in future travels it s such a long flight to argentina and i was only there for days said ms snook a publishing professional i m aware of how alcohol affects me and i chose to prioritize feeling amazing every day of the trip over dealing with a hangover during her visit ms snook bicycled between vineyards reveled in breathtaking scenery relaxed with spa treatments and engaged with sommeliers and winemakers coming away with a new appreciation for sustainable and regenerative agriculture the obvious question when you tell someone that you aren t drinking is out of all the places you could go why travel to wine country she said but to me it makes perfect sense because these regions offer all the perks of luxury travel wellness amenities beautiful landscapes and fine dining ,The New York Times,Travel
6,"This past October, I found myself in Yoshida Village standing before a tatara, a giant open-top furnace that was filled with charcoal and raging with such controlled ferocity that it could have been a set piece in Lucifer’s bedroom.

Deep within the belly of those orange flames sat a growing and mangled ingot that contained some exceptionally high-quality steel called tamahagane, or jewel steel, from which Japanese swords have been made for much of the country’s history. The presence of a usable ingot seemed unlikely, and if true, downright alchemic. All we had been doing for the last 20 hours was gently shaking iron sand and fresh charcoal onto the flames at timed intervals.

Yoshida is nestled back in the mountains of Shimane Prefecture in central Japan, abutting the ever-turbulent Sea of Japan. For nearly 700 years, workers around Yoshida made jewel steel in places called tatara-ba (literally “furnace spots”) on a grueling schedule — one that reshaped mountains and rivers, that seared the brows of generations of sooty men shoveling charcoal in loincloths. Then, at the start of the 20th century, production all but ceased.

But last week, a stream of radiant lava burst from a crater a few miles from the resort, forcing it to evacuate hundreds of guests, in yet another eruption of a volcano system in the Reykjanes Peninsula that had been dormant for 800 years.

The outbursts began in 2021, and the eruptions and earthquakes in the peninsula have destroyed some houses and forced villagers from their homes. One construction worker went missing in the town of Grindavik after falling down a crack caused by an earthquake.

But despite her circle of famed confidants, she died in relative obscurity in Boulder, Colo., in 1987.

9,"Determining whether someone has Alzheimer’s disease usually requires an extended diagnostic process. A doctor takes a patient’s medical history, discusses symptoms, administers verbal and visual cognitive tests.

The patient may undergo a PET scan, an M.R.I. or a spinal tap — tests that detect the presence of two proteins in the brain, amyloid plaques and tau tangles, both associated with Alzheimer’s.

All of that could change dramatically if new criteria proposed by an Alzheimer’s Association working group are widely adopted.

Its final recommendations, expected later this year, will accelerate a shift that is already underway: from defining the disease by symptoms and behavior to defining it purely biologically — with biomarkers, substances in the body that indicate disease.",determining whether someone has alzheimer s disease usually requires an extended diagnostic process a doctor takes a patient s medical history discusses symptoms administers verbal and visual cognitive tests the patient may undergo a pet scan an m r i or a spinal tap tests that detect the presence of two proteins in the brain amyloid plaques and tau tangles both associated with alzheimer s all of that could change dramatically if new criteria proposed by an alzheimer s association working group are widely adopted its final recommendations expected later this year will accelerate a shift that is already underway from defining the disease by symptoms and behavior to defining it purely biologically with biomarkers substances in the body that indicate disease ,The New York Times,Health

That is not what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet chose to do in the predawn hours of Friday, and in interviews, analysts and nuclear experts said the decision was telling.

So was the silence that followed. Israel said almost nothing about the limited strike, which appeared to do little damage in Iran. U.S. officials noted that the Iranian decision to downplay the explosions in Isfahan — and the suggestions by Iranian officials that Israel may not have been responsible — was a clear effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to avoid another round of escalation.

The bank he leads, Utah-based Sunwest, last month was named as a co-defendant in a California lawsuit that accuses a senior living facility partly owned by the bank of elder abuse, negligence and wrongful death.

Mr. Hovde’s campaign called the suit meritless and said it was farcical to hold the chairman and chief executive of a bank responsible for the actions of a business that it seized in a foreclosure in 2021. Whatever its merits, the suit might have been largely irrelevant to Mr. Hovde’s political campaign had he himself not boasted recently of having gained expertise in the nursing home industry as a lender to such residences.

In comments this month in which he suggested there had been irregularities in the 2020 election, Mr. Hovde drew on that experience to say that residents of nursing homes “have a five-, six-month life expectancy” and that “almost nobody in a nursing home is at a point to vote.” Those remarks were quickly condemned by Democrats in Wisconsin and by the former Milwaukee Bucks star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.",eric hovde the republican banking executive challenging senator tammy baldwin in wisconsin may be developing a problem with older voters the bank he leads utah based sunwest last month was named as a co defendant in a california lawsuit that accuses a senior living facility partly owned by the bank of elder abuse negligence and wrongful death mr hovde s campaign called the suit meritless and said it was farcical to hold the chairman and chief executive of a bank responsible for the actions of a business that it seized in a foreclosure in whatever its merits the suit might have been largely irrelevant to mr hovde s political campaign had he himself not boasted recently of having gained expertise in the nursing home industry as a lender to such residences in comments this month in which he suggested there had been irregularities in the election mr hovde drew on that experience to say that residents of nursing homes have a five six month life expectancy and that almost nobody in a nursing home is at a point to vote those remarks were quickly condemned by democrats in wisconsin and by the former milwaukee bucks star kareem abdul jabbar ,The New York Times,Politics

But conversations with her younger relatives, who have told her they’re unsure of voting or considering staying home, illustrate some of the challenges Mr. Biden’s campaign faces in reassembling his winning 2020 coalition, particularly in key battleground states like Georgia. While Ms. Green and many older Black voters are set on voting and already have plans in place to do so, younger Black voters, polling and focus group data show, feel far less motivated to cast a ballot for Democrats or even at all.

17," — For the past decade, Nigeria’s best-known ambassadors have, arguably, been its musicians: Burna Boy, WizKid, Davido, Tiwa Savage Asake and Tems, who have popularized Afrobeats beyond West Africa. At a moment when music, literature, visual art and food from across the African continent continue to gain global popularity, fashion designers, particularly those from Nigeria, are ready for their industry to take center stage.

“Designers have become better and more confident, said Reni Folawiyo, owner of Alara, a popular concept store in Lagos. “Some have come back from different parts of the world and are creating things that are interesting to people; some are making more contemporary pieces that people can wear every day. There’s more variety, and people feel proud to be wearing things made by Africans.” In 2023, Alara opened a pop-up shop as part of the Brooklyn Museum’s “Africa Fashion” exhibition.

19,"There’s often a bias against the idea of flashiness, especially in classical music circles, as if it must always be preceded by the word “empty.”

But not on Wednesday at David Geffen Hall, where the conductor Andrés Orozco-Estrada and the cellist Edgar Moreau were making their New York Philharmonic debuts. If anything, the word that accompanied their kind of flashiness was “fun.”

By offering plenty of buoyancy — and largely skirting grave weight — the programming communicated this conductor’s zealous pursuit of entertainment. It ran from a rousing take on Tchaikovsky’s “Romeo and Juliet” Overture-Fantasy to a graceful (and yes, occasionally flashy) Haydn Cello Concerto No. 1, then, after intermission, a truly aggressive reading of Bartok’s “Miraculous Mandarin” Suite and a boisterous finale in Enescu’s Romanian Rhapsody No. 1.

That’s an evening built to dazzle and entertain. But there was substance as well. From the outset of Tchaikovsky’s crowd-pleaser, Orozco-Estrada had the Philharmonic players in fine balance: Plucked strings had presence; entrances of flute or harp came across clearly; a roll of percussion heightened tension without calling too much early attention to itself.",there s often a bias against the idea of flashiness especially in classical music circles as if it must always be preceded by the word empty but not on wednesday at david geffen hall where the conductor andrés orozco estrada and the cellist edgar moreau were making their new york philharmonic debuts if anything the word that accompanied their kind of flashiness was fun by offering plenty of buoyancy and largely skirting grave weight the programming communicated this conductor s zealous pursuit of entertainment it ran from a rousing take on tchaikovsky s romeo and juliet overture fantasy to a graceful and yes occasionally flashy haydn cello concerto no then after intermission a truly aggressive reading of bartok s miraculous mandarin suite and a boisterous finale in enescu s romanian rhapsody no that s an evening built to dazzle and entertain but there was substance as well from the outset of tchaikovsky s crowd pleaser orozco estrada had the philharmonic players in fine balance plucked strings had presence entrances of flute or harp came across clearly a roll of percussion heightened tension without calling too much early attention to itself ,The New York Times,Entertainment
20,"I first learned about padel last summer, when my partner sent me a photo from a small court during a visit to Germany.

What is that? I wondered.

“Padel. A childish version of tennis,” he texted, anticipating my question.

As an enthusiastic tennis player, I was not very interested.

A few months later, while biking in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I noticed a large building with a sign that read “Padel Haus,” which billed itself as the first padel club in New York City. This sport wanted my attention, so I invited Victor Mather, a veteran sports reporter, to join me for a lesson.

Victor was willing to try. “I am a reasonably fit guy,” he said. But he was turning 60, he said, and added: “My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, I haven’t played tennis since prep school, and I have never played squash or racquetball.”",i first learned about padel last summer when my partner sent me a photo from a small court during a visit to germany what is that i wondered padel a childish version of tennis he texted anticipating my question as an enthusiastic tennis player i was not very interested a few months later while biking in williamsburg brooklyn i noticed a large building with a sign that read padel haus which billed itself as the first padel club in new york city this sport wanted my attention so i invited victor mather a veteran sports reporter to join me for a lesson victor was willing to try i am a reasonably fit guy he said but he was turning he said and added my eyesight isn t what it used to be i haven t played tennis since prep school and i have never played squash or racquetball ,The New York Times,Sports
21,"For the small, insular world of triathlon, it has been a week.

Last Monday, the International Testing Agency announced that Collin Chartier, a top American triathlete who had something of a breakout season last year, had tested positive for erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, a performance-enhancing substance that has long been a favorite among endurance athletes.

EPO stimulates the production of red blood cells, which helps the body transport oxygen, ultimately increasing stamina. For years in professional cycling, it was about as common as saddle sores. Also, after more than two decades of doping scandals in nearly every sport, from track and field to baseball, most athletes, sports officials and fans have come to react to the latest positive test in the manner of Captain Renault entering Rick’s Cafe in “Casablanca.”

“I’m shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.”

And yet Chartier’s positive test, his acceptance of a three-year suspension from competition and his subsequent attempts — on one of the sport’s leading podcasts and on social media — to own the violation, have rocked triathlon, producing the kind of shock and outrage over doping that recall a more innocent era.

“It’s really blown up the sport,” said Dan Plews, who coaches several elite triathletes, including Chelsea Sodaro, the reigning Ironman world champion.",for the small insular world of triathlon it has been a week last monday the international testing agency announced that collin chartier a top american triathlete who had something of a breakout season last year had tested positive for erythropoietin commonly known as epo a performance enhancing substance that has long been a favorite among endurance athletes epo stimulates the production of red blood cells which helps the body transport oxygen ultimately increasing stamina for years in professional cycling it was about as common as saddle sores also after more than two decades of doping scandals in nearly every sport from track and field to baseball most athletes sports officials and fans have come to react to the latest positive test in the manner of captain renault entering rick s cafe in casablanca i m shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on in here and yet chartier s positive test his acceptance of a three year suspension from competition and his subsequent attempts on one of the sport s leading podcasts and on social media to own the violation have rocked triathlon producing the kind of shock and outrage over doping that recall a more innocent era it s really blown up the sport said dan plews who coaches several elite triathletes including chelsea sodaro the reigning ironman world champion ,The New York Times,Sports
22,"Track and field will be the first sport to give direct cash payments for Olympic gold medals, the sport’s federation announced Wednesday.

For decades, the Olympics trumpeted the ideal of amateurism. It took pride in being a competition where elite athletes battled for nothing more than the joy of representing their country.

Amateurism was touted as the best way to keep sports clean, fair and honest. “Professionalism” was looked down on as vulgar and mercenary. But the notion of amateurism at the Olympics has eroded over the last three decades, as professional athletes have been allowed to participate.

Now World Athletics, the global governing body for track and field, will break new ground by making payments to competitors more straightforward: All individual gold medalists in the sport at the Paris Games this summer will receive $50,000.

23," — The House on Saturday passed a $95 billion package that includes two long-awaited bills with $60.8 billion of aid for Ukraine and $26 billion in aid for Israel.

The Ukraine bill, which passed 311- 112 with one present, will head to the Senate alongside the Israel aid bill and two others — one with aid for Taiwan and another that would force TikTok's parent company to sell the platform.

Lawmakers waved Ukrainian flags and cheered upon the Ukraine bill's passage. Voting in favor were 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats, while Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., voted present. All 112 votes against it came from Republicans.

The Israel bill passed 366-58, with 193 Republicans and 173 Democrats voting in favor.

The bills passed weeks after the Senate passed a mammoth bill with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as funding for border security. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., refused to bring that bill to the floor, instead opting to pass three separate bills with aid for the three nations.

The Ukraine aid bill comes at a crucial time in the country’s war with Russia, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed the urgent need for weapons and supplies to continue defending Ukraine from Russian attacks.

President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., lauded the House for passing the bills Saturday, with Biden saying in a statement that a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted to ""send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage.""

""At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history’s call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,"" he said.

In a separate statement, McConnell said: “Today’s action moves this critical national security supplemental one step closer to helping America and our friends to meet the most dangerous array of threats in a generation. From the battlefields of Ukraine to the cities and kibbutzes of Israel, and from the Red Sea to the South China Sea, our adversaries are colluding to violently undermine America, our allies, and our global interests.""

The House also voted Saturday to force TikTok’s parent company to sell it or be banned in the U.S. According to the bill, China-based ByteDance would have to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which would lengthen the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden’s support, putting TikTok closer than ever to being banned in the U.S.

The House also voted to provide $8.12 billion in aid to Taiwan.

The House voted on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed up the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the “rule” to proceed to the measures.

The three foreign aid bills will now go to the Senate. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by Biden, with some changes from the version the Senate passed two months ago.

Holding the votes was an act of defiance by Johnson against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose funding for Ukraine and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have threatened to oust him as speaker. Passing the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.

After months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: “Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.”

“I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,” Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. “This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is for so many American families. This is not a game. This is not a joke.”

Before the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.

The bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It’s unclear when that will happen. McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.

“I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,” Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend itself.

Late Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. “We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,” he said on the Senate floor.

McConnell said earlier this week: “Here’s the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there’s no question where the blame will land, on us.”", the house on saturday passed a billion package that includes two long awaited

24," — Four California men who were associated with the ""Three Percenter"" militia group and convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack were taken into custody Friday after a judge ordered them to serve sentences ranging from 21 to 33 months in federal prison, far below what the government had requested.

Erik Scott Warner, Felipe Antonio Martinez, Derek Kinnison and Ronald Mele were all found guilty of felony obstruction of an official proceeding and other charges after a trial last year. One of their co-defendants, former California police chief Alan Hostetter, was sentenced to more than 11 years in federal prison in December. The trials featured testimony from co-defendant Russell Taylor, who pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal with the government.

The felony charge they were convicted of — obstruction of an official proceeding — is currently before the Supreme Court, where some of the justices seemed skeptical of the way the government had used the charge. A decision in that case is expected in the coming months. If the Supreme Court guts the charge, two of the defendants could end up only serving 12 months in prison on their misdemeanor convictions.

The men communicated over a ""The California Patriots — DC Brigade"" Telegram chat and brought weapons on their trip to Washington to participate in Jan. 6, according to evidence shown at trial. They kept a shotgun in their car, and Kinnison and Mele claimed they stored five handguns in their hotel room ""despite understanding that it was illegal,"" the government said. “We’re packing light just a scatter gun and a pistol a piece,"" Martinez joked, according to prosecutors.

Mele took photographs of the handguns, holsters, ammunition and magazines the group brought into their hotel room. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia

Prosecutors had sought lengthy sentences for the foursome between 6.5 and eight years in federal prison, but Judge Royce Lamberth landed on much lower sentences within the guidelines range.

Warner received 27 months after telling Lamberth that he ""got caught up"" in the mob and was sorry for his conduct. ""I shouldn't have been there,"" he said, apologizing to his family for putting them ""through hell.""

Martinez received 21 months in prison after he said he was ""very sorry"" and apologized for his conduct, telling Lamberth that he would ""never see me back here.""

Kinnison was sentenced to 33 months in prison. He spoke about his love of God, family and country and said he admired the ""Judeo-Christian principles that the country was founded upon."" He said that he did repent for his sins and ask forgiveness for his sins and that he was praying for Lamberth and the prosecutors on the case.

Mele was also sentenced to 33 months. Prosecutors said he ""awarded"" his co-conspirators a ""Capitol Action Badge"" a few weeks after Jan. 6, which prosecutors described as a ""crudely modified version of a real military reward."" He said Jan. 6 ""gave this country a black eye"" that was still tender. Mele said he had pulled himself away from politics and that the experience of going through trial and seeing videos of some of the horrific violence at the Capitol had ""opened my eyes."" He said that he didn't condone what happened, calling it ""asinine.""

The government had sought eight years in prison for all the defendants except for Martinez, who they said should serve six and a half years.

The stakes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mariano argued, could not be much higher, and the defendants here were in a “rare class” of Jan. 6 defendants who “worked together and had a plan” and were convicted in a criminal conspiracy. They came to Washington with “everything a soldier going into battle needs,” he noted.

""We are 262 days away from Jan. 6, 2025,"" Mariano said Friday, arguing that the sentence imposed ""needs to consider January 6, 2025, 2029, 2033, and so on.""

More than 1,387 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, with more than 984 defendants having been convicted. Of the more than 859 defendants who have been sentenced, more than 520 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration of a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.

The overwhelming majority of Jan. 6 defendants in custody either admitted to their criminal conduct or were found guilty at trial; only about 15 defendants in pretrial custody.

25,"The New Yorkers who could decide Donald Trump’s fate were vetted in real time on Friday by the former president’s defense team.

As the potential alternate jurors were being questioned by prosecutors seeking to convict Trump of illegally paying hush money to a porn star, and by defense attorneys trying to keep him out of jail, a jury consultant hired by Trump's legal team was watching the candidates closely for telltale signs of possible bias while simultaneously feeding the defense attorneys her impressions.

Follow along for live updates

Meanwhile, other jury consultants say, it is likely that a team of researchers working with the jury consultant were doing social media and other online searches to fill out the picture of every potential juror and sending that information to Trump’s lawyers in the courtroom.

“All this has to happen relatively quickly,” said veteran jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitrius of Dimitrius & Associates, who has been following the case and identified the firm working for Trump as Magna Legal Services.

The Philadelphia-based firm did not respond to a call from NBC News but court records show that Magna served as Trump’s jury consultant when was ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll for defaming her in 2019.

It was not immediately clear if the Manhattan District Attorney’s office used its own jury consultant to vet jurors and a spokesperson for the agency did not return numerous phone calls from NBC News.

By midday, jury selection had been completed and Trump's first trial was heading for opening arguments.

Using jury consultants for vetting has become a fairly common practice.

“In my experience, there’s usually a consultant sitting behind the lawyers with a laptop who is feeding information to the lawyer doing the questioning of jurors,” Dimitrius said. “They usually have the home office doing the social media checks and other searches because the primary role of the consultant in the courtroom is to listen and watch the jurors and give feedback to the lawyers.”

Sometimes the background checks of potential jurors are being done even before the questioning begins, Dimitrius said.

“Generally on the morning of jury selection you get a list of potential jurors,” she said. “So we will take an iPhone photo of the list and send it back to the office where they’ll start their searches.”

Tampa-based jury consultant Michael Boucher of TCS, who has worked on a number of high-profile cases in New York City, like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s failed libel case versus the New York Times, echoed Dimitrius.

“In a case like this, we would set up a laptop on the podium and use a messaging app to stay in contact with the lawyers questioning the jurors,” Boucher said. “Not only are you feeding the lawyer information, you are finding on the jurors online, you’re trying to help guide the lawyer asking the questions. Lawyers, at times, sometimes get too far into the weeds and they need assistance so they can come up with follow-up questions.”

At the same time, Boucher said, “We’re watching the reactions of the other jurors waiting to be questioned and feeding that information to our legal team. That way, when the next potential juror steps up we already have a sense of where they stand.”

Boucher said in his experience Manhattan jury pools tend to be sophisticated, well-educated and thoughtful. But cases involving polarizing figures like Trump or Palin “sometime attract what we call 'motivated jurors,' with strong feelings either for or against"" them.

“It’s very hard to find anybody who doesn’t have an opinion about Trump,” he said.

NBC News Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos, an attorney who practices in New York and elsewhere, agreed.

“In virtually every other case in the world, there’s not a strong chance that the jurors have tweeted about the defendant or posted on social media,"" Cevallos said. ""This is the rare one-in-a-million case where there’s a good chance all of us have retweeted or tweeted something about Donald Trump.""

Renato Stabile, managing director at Dubin Research & Consulting in New York City, said the ability to track social media has revolutionized the way juries get picked — and how jury consultants do their jobs.

“Before you just had to rely on what jurors said in court, and I think lawyers depended a lot more on their experience and gut, and maybe unfortunately, stereotypes that were either correct or incorrect and their past experience,"" Stabile said. ""Now you just get such a better sense of what jurors are really all about based on the articles they’re liking, what they’re reposting.""

Examining social media is ""probably the most important part of jury selection,” said David Oscar Markus, a criminal defense attorney who, among others, successfully defended former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum against charges of lying to the FBI.

“Lots of folks will come into court and say, ‘Yes, of course, I can be fair,’ or, ‘I have feelings about this one way or the other, but I can put all those aside and give the prosecution and defense a fair shake',"" Markus said. ""But then, once you see posts, even if they’re old posts, they reveal sort of the jurors’ true feelings.”

gut and maybe unfortunately stereotypes that were either correct or incorrect and their past experience stabile said now you just get such a better sense of what jurors are really all about based on the articles they re liking what they re reposting examining social media is probably the most important part of jury selection said david oscar markus a criminal defense attorney who among others successfully defended former tallahassee mayor andrew gillum against charges of lying to the fbi lots of folks will come into court and say yes of course i can be fair or i have feelings about this one way or the other but i can put all those aside and give the prosecution and defense a fair shake markus said but then once you see posts even if they re old posts they reveal sort of the jurors

26,"The automaker Hyundai said it had paused its advertising on Elon Musk’s social media app, X, after a sponsored post from the company appeared next to antisemitic and pro-Nazi posts.

Hyundai confirmed the pause in a statement to NBC News late Wednesday and said it was taking its brand safety concerns to Musk’s company.

“We have paused our ads on X and are speaking to X directly about brand safety to ensure this issue is addressed,” Hyundai said in the statement.

Nancy Levine Stearns, a freelance journalist and X user, posted a screenshot Wednesday of a Hyundai ad running on an X account that often posts Holocaust denial and antisemitism. Stearns has written about brand safety on X for Hill Reporter, a progressive news site.

Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, confirmed the Hyundai pause in an email Thursday in response to questions. He said X was working with Hyundai’s marketers to put in place further brand safety controls.

X also suspended the account that made the antisemitic posts. The account’s bio included antisemitic tropes that violated X’s policy against abusive profiles, Benarroch said. A note on the account Thursday afternoon said it was “temporarily unavailable” because it violated policy.

Benarroch also said a Holocaust-denial post that appeared adjacent to a Hyundai ad would get a label as violating X’s policy on “violent event denial.”

On Tuesday, an NBC News investigation documented how X has become a hub for pro-Nazi content. X’s policies ban glorifying violence and praising violent entities.

Hyundai is the world’s third-largest automaker by sales volume, after Toyota and Volkswagen. Its headquarters are in South Korea, and its brands include Kia.

The recent Hyundai ad in question ran on the profile of a user who has defended Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and pushed antisemitic conspiracy theories. Before Thursday’s suspension, the account said it was based in Australia. It posted under a pseudonym and had more than 55,000 followers.

The account for months has had a blue checkmark signaling that it is a paid “Premium” subscriber. This month, X began giving blue checkmarks to some unpaid users with more than 2,500 verified followers, making it more difficult to determine who is a paid subscriber, but the account in question has had its blue checkmark for longer.

NBC News reported Tuesday that under Musk’s ownership, X has become a thriving spot for explicitly pro-Nazi content, including speeches by Hitler or content praising his genocidal regime. NBC News found that at least 150 paid “Premium” subscriber accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts had posted or amplified pro-Nazi content in recent months, often in apparent violation of X’s rules.

Some pro-Nazi content has spread widely, including a post last month with 1.9 million views promoting a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6 million Jews did not die in the Holocaust. On Thursday, X added a label to the post, saying: “Visibility limited: this Post may violate X’s rules against Hateful Conduct.”

NBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 “Premium” accounts, either on their profile pages or in the replies below their posts.

Another X advertiser, IQAir, said it was adjusting its settings on the platform after NBC News found one of its ads running adjacent to Holocaust denial. IQAir, a Swiss company that makes air quality devices and software, said it was already using X’s features designed to let advertisers target certain audiences and exclude other audiences.

“Our advertisements are set up so that ideally, they do not allow X to reach accounts beyond our target audience,” the company said in an email.

“However, based on the screen shot you provided, it appears that did not occur in this case,” it said. The company said it did not know why its ad would appear next to extremist content.

X offers advertisers a feature called “negative targeting” designed to stop ads from being placed near certain keywords. However, the system does not by default include all potentially problematic keywords. IQAir said it was adding a Holocaust denial hashtag to its list of excluded keywords, and X said it was demonetizing searches for the same hashtag and making the hashtag ineligible to appear in trending lists or in search results.

“We do not condone our advertisements running in conjunction with this or any other form of extremist content,” IQAir said.

X said it had suspended one account whose Holocaust-denial post had appeared next to an IQAir ad. The account had an abusive profile, Benarroch said. X also applied a label for “hateful conduct” to another antisemitic post, he said.

NBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each account on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is unknown how many advertisers’ ads have run next to pro-Nazi content or Holocaust denial posts.

X has faced a widespread advertiser backlash since November, when Musk embraced the “great replacement theory,” which says there is a top-down plot to replace the white population with nonwhite people. Musk responded to a post by a conspiracy theorist by saying, “You have said the actual truth.”

Dozens of major advertisers, including Disney, Apple and Warner Bros., halted their advertising on X, and as of February many had not resumed. According to the research firm Sensor Tower, 75 out of the top 100 U.S. advertisers on X from October 2022 were not buying ads as of February.

Musk visited Israel later in November and traveled to the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz in January.

Musk, also the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said after the Auschwitz visit that he did not know much about antisemitism and considered himself “Jewish by association.”

“I must admit to being somewhat frankly naive about this. In the circles that I move, I see almost no antisemitism. … Two-thirds of my friends are Jewish,” he said.",the automaker hyundai said it had paused its advertising on elon musk s social media app x

27,"Boston Dynamics unveiled Wednesday a new version of its humanoid robot, “Atlas,” that the company says is “designed for real-world applications.”

Like many of its previous announcements, the company released a video of its robot in action.

The company is moving full steam (or spark) ahead with its new fully electric iteration of Atlas, and retiring its previously hydraulic-powered model.

At the core of the transition is Boston Dynamics' partnership with Hyundai — which the company credits for aiding in, ""building the next generation of automotive manufacturing capabilities,"" according to Boston Dynamics's blog post.

""In the months and years ahead, we’re excited to show what the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot can really do — in the lab, in the factory, and in our lives,"" read the company's blog.

However, beyond the nuts and bolts of the robot's new design, the release left many on social media sputtering with skepticism. Some users on X likened the launch of Atlas to something out of James Cameron's iconic post-apocalyptic ""Terminator"" franchise.

""It’s giving 'call an ambulance ... but not for me,'"" joked tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee.

The original Atlas robot can be seen on Boston Dynamic's website performing a range of tasks, including lifting objects and even busting out dance moves.

The company said that its new electric model breaks new ground.

""The electric version of Atlas will be stronger, with a broader range of motion than any of our previous generations,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our last generation hydraulic Atlas (HD Atlas) could already lift and maneuver a wide variety of heavy, irregular objects; we are continuing to build on those existing capabilities and are exploring several new gripper variations to meet a diverse set of expected manipulation needs in customer environments.""

28,"Trader Joe’s has recalled packaged herbs linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak, the grocery chain announced this week.

The product, Infinite Herbs organic basil, was sold in 2.5-ounce clamshell containers from Feb. 1 to April 6 in 29 states, as well as in Washington, D.C., Trader Joe’s said Wednesday.

There have been 12 reports in seven states of people being infected with salmonella, an organism that can cause serious or fatal illness, according to federal officials. One person was hospitalized.

“Seven of eight cases with information available reported exposure to fresh organic basil purchased from Trader Joe’s before becoming ill,” the Food and Drug Administration said on its website, adding that “traceback data” it had collected determined that Florida-based Infinite Herbs had supplied the basil to Trader Joe’s.

Grego Berliavsky, the head of Infinite Herbs, said Wednesday that the company had voluntarily recalled the product.

“I am heartbroken at the thought that any item we sold may have caused illness or discomfort,” he said in a statement. “We simply will not rest until we can once again be confident in the safety of this product.”

Berliavsky added that customers should check their freezers for the basil.

“Fresh basil naturally wilts and expires after five to seven days, so we are confident that the recalled basil is no longer available for sale,” he wrote. “However, if you have food in your freezer that includes Infinite Herbs organic basil purchased between February 1 and April 6, do not consume it.”

The basil had been sourced from a single farm, which is no longer in production, Berliavsky said.

“We are working with the farmer to conduct an internal investigation of the food safety practices. Through this investigation, our goal is to determine the cause of this recall and apply measures to prevent it from happening again,” he wrote.

Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The symptoms usually start six hours to six days after infection, and while most people recover within a week without antibiotics, some may need medical treatment. The CDC says that children younger than 5, adults 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get serious salmonella infections but that anyone who has severe diarrhea, bloody stools, a fever higher than 102 degrees or prolonged vomiting may need antibiotics or to be hospitalized.

Salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations and 420 deaths in the U.S. every year, according to the CDC. But official counts are likely to be an underestimate because most people recover without seeking medical help or without confirmed diagnoses, said Barbara Kowalcyk, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

Infections come from a variety of sources, including consuming contaminated food and water or touching infected animals and their environments.

In rare cases, salmonella or its toxins can enter the bloodstream, causing serious illnesses, death or long-term conditions like arthritis, Kowalcyk said.

""One of the things in food safety that we try to do is make people aware that it's not just this bad tummy ache,"" she said. ""There are other health implications.""

Salmonella is not visible, and it cannot be smelled or tasted, Kowalcyk said. Trader Joe’s instructed customers to discard the packaged basil or to return it for a full refund.

The FDA said infections have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin; the product was also distributed in Alabama, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Vermont.

The news comes a month after another large Trader Joe’s recall involving potential salmonella contamination. In March, the grocer recalled cashews sold in 16 states. No illnesses were reported in that instance. Earlier in March, Trader Joe’s recalled steamed chicken soup dumplings that federal officials said could be contaminated with “hard plastic from a permanent marker pen.”",trader joe s has recalled packaged herbs linked to a multistate salmonella outbreak the grocery chain announced this week the product infinite herbs organic basil was sold in ounce clamshell containers from feb to april in states as well as in washington d c trader joe s said wednesday there have been reports in seven states of people being infected with salmonella an organism that can cause serious or fatal illness according to federal officials one person was hospitalized seven of eight cases with information available reported exposure to fresh organic basil purchased from trader joe s before becoming ill the food and drug administration said on its website adding that traceback data it had collected determined that florida based infinite herbs had supplied the basil to trader joe s grego berliavsky the head of infinite herbs said wednesday that the company had voluntarily recalled the product i am heartbroken at the thought that any item we sold may have caused illness or discomfort he said in a statement we simply will not rest until we can once again be confident in the safety of this product berliavsky added that customers should check their freezers for the basil fresh basil naturally wilts and expires after five to seven days so we are confident that the recalled basil is no longer available for sale he wrote however if you have food in your freezer that includes infinite herbs organic basil purchased between february and april do not consume it the basil had been sourced from a single farm which is no longer in production berliavsky said we are working with the farmer to conduct an internal investigation of the food safety practices through this investigation our goal is to determine the cause of this recall and apply measures to prevent it from happening again he wrote symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea fever and stomach cramps according to the centers for disease control and prevention the symptoms usually start six hours to six days after infection and while most people recover within a week without antibiotics some may need medical treatment the cdc says that children younger than adults and older and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get serious salmonella infections but that anyone who has severe diarrhea bloody stools a fever higher than degrees or prolonged vomiting may need antibiotics or to be hospitalized salmonella causes about million infections hospitalizations and deaths in the u s every year according to the cdc but official counts are likely to be an underestimate because most people recover without seeking medical help or without confirmed diagnoses said barbara kowalcyk an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the george washington university milken institute school of public health infections come from a variety of sources including consuming contaminated food and water or touching infected animals and their environments in rare cases salmonella or its toxins can enter the bloodstream causing serious illnesses death or long term conditions like arthritis kowalcyk said one of the things in food safety that we try to do is make people aware that it s not just this bad tummy ache she said there are other health implications salmonella is not visible and it cannot be smelled or tasted kowalcyk said trader joe s instructed customers to discard the packaged basil or to return it for a full refund the fda said infections have been reported in florida georgia minnesota missouri new jersey rhode island and wisconsin the product was also distributed in alabama connecticut washington d c delaware iowa illinois indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts maryland maine michigan north carolina nebraska new hampshire new york ohio pennsylvania south carolina tennessee virginia and vermont the news comes a month after another large trader joe s recall involving potential salmonella contamination in march the grocer recalled cashews sold in states no illnesses were reported in that instance earlier in march trader joe s recalled steamed chicken soup dumplings that federal officials said could be contaminated with hard plastic from a permanent marker pen ,NBC News,Health
29,"At least 19 women in nine states reportedly became sick after they got Botox, either having gotten the injections from people who were never licensed or trained to give the shots or received them in ""non-healthcare settings,"" including homes or spas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.

Nine of the 19 patients were hospitalized, the CDC said. Four ""were treated with botulism antitoxin because of concerns that the botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site.""

Botox uses a purified form of a neurotoxin called botulinum toxin that prevents muscles from moving for a period of time. The product is often used to prevent or ease facial wrinkles. When the toxin is found in food, it can lead to widespread paralysis and even death.

But when it is injected carefully, botulinum toxin is generally considered safe. Too much in the wrong places can be damaging, according to the CDC.

Cases have been detected in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Washington. No deaths have been reported.

It is unclear whether the reactions were the result of fake products, contamination or poor hygiene practices. The CDC's investigation is ongoing, the agency said.

The Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Friday that it was involved with the investigation.

Warnings about medical procedures at unregulated med spas are rising. Colorado health officials told NBC News that they're investigating a case of botulism-like illness after an unlicensed provider injected a patient with what was allegedly botulinum toxin. The Illinois patients received injections from a nurse ""who was performing work outside her authority,"" according to the state's Public Health Department.

31,"Beyoncé shared an Instagram post Tuesday explaining the inspiration behind her coming album, ""Cowboy Carter.""

She wrote that she has been working for five years on “Cowboy Carter,” a project ""born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed.""

Fans speculated that Beyoncé was referring to the 2016 Country Music Awards, during which she performed her song ""Daddy Lessons"" with the country group The Chicks. While Beyoncé fans celebrated the performance, it also drew backlash at the time.

“Cowboy Carter” is the second installment of a three-part project that started with the release of Beyonce’s 2022 dance music album, “Renaissance.” Many believe the project is her attempt to reclaim genres of music pioneered by Black artists.

When Beyoncé released the singles ""Texas Hold 'Em"" and ""16 Carriages,"" Black country artists said they hoped her coming album would bring more exposure to Black country music.

Beyoncé wrote that her experience motivated her to do a ""deeper dive"" into the history of country music.

""The criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me,"" she wrote. ""act ii is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.""

While the singles off of ""Cowboy Carter"" have been country songs, Beyoncé wrote: ""This ain’t a Country album. This is a 'Beyoncé' album."" She also said the album is a ""continuation of Renaissance.""

Beyoncé recently made history as the first Black woman to top the Billboard country chart with her single ""Texas Hold 'Em."" In her Instagram post, she said she was ""honored"" to do so.

""That would not have happened without the outpouring of support from each and every one of you,” she wrote on Instagram. ""My hope is that years from now, the mention of an artist’s race, as it relates to releasing genres of music, will be irrelevant.""

32," — In a global first for equality in sports, wheelchair athletes and non-disabled runners participating in the London Marathon on Sunday were competing for the exact same prize money.

The move makes the event the only marathon in the world to award winners the same sum — $55,000 for first place, $30,000 for the runners-up and $22,500 for third-place finishers. Organizers said they were unaware of any other major athletic event in any sport that has taken a similar step.

By equalizing the prize pot, marathon organizers have said they hope to pave the way for other races and sporting events to offer parity, encouraging more athletes to participate in disability sport and removing financial barriers to participation. The parity extends to gender: Both male and female wheelchair athletes are eligible for equal prize amounts.

The men's wheelchair division race was won by Marcel Hug, a Paralympian widely considered the world’s best wheelchair racer, who cheered the decision ahead of the race.

“The London Marathon is setting a great and strong but also courageous example for equality and inclusion that should go beyond the world of sport and hopefully inspires in other areas, too,” Hug told NBC News.

Hug crossed the line in one hour, 28 minutes and 35 seconds in London to claim his fifth victory.

American athlete Daniel Romanchuk placed second behind Hug. In third was British wheelchair racing star David Weir, a six-time Paralympic gold medalist who’s won the London race eight times before — more than any other athlete.

Swiss athlete Catherine Debrunne won the women's event with a time of one hour, 3 minutes and 54 seconds.

Manuela Schar, also from Switzerland came in second and American Tatyana McFadden placed third.

In Boston, the top prize for the wheelchair division was $40,000. In the open division, the non-disabled male and female winners took home $150,000 — more than three times as much.

The 26.2-mile race in London kicked off Sunday morning south of the Thames River, crossing over Tower Bridge and passing iconic London landmarks like the Tower of London, the London Eye and the Big Ben before reaching the finish line near Buckingham Palace.

Hugh Brasher, the London Marathon’s event director, cast the move as part of an evolution toward greater inclusion for athletes with disabilities that started in 1983 when the London race held its first wheelchair event, and continued with multiple International Paralympic Committee World Championships held since then in the British capital.

Romanchuk, 25, who grew up in Maryland, applauded the decision to equalize the prize structure, predicting it would have “huge effects beyond race day.”

“London Marathon’s equal prize money helps elevate perception of the sport to reflect the reality that we’re professional athletes, training and competing just like other professional athletes,” Romanchuk told NBC News as he traveled to London for the race. “My main hope is that it brings more visibility to the sport so that more athletes with disabilities can see the possibility of having an active lifestyle and participate in community running races.”

Another reason why equalizing the financial aspect of sports is important, Romanchuk said, is that the high cost of specialized equipment for wheelchair racing often prevents lower-income athletes from getting involved. He said adaptive sports equipment starts at several thousands of dollars at entry level — far more than the pair of running shoes that a nondisabled athlete would need to start competing.

Romanchuk said he’d first gotten involved in adaptive sports when he was 2 years old, describing the effect it had on his development and self-confidence.

“They taught me to focus on what I did have — two strong arms — instead of what I didn’t have,” said Romanchuk, who was born with spina bifida, a congenital defect that affects the spinal cord. “The fact that my legs didn’t work normally was never an acceptable reason why I couldn’t reach a particular goal.”", in a global first for equality in sports wheelchair athletes and non disabled runners participating in the london marathon on sunday were competing for the exact same prize money the move makes the event the only marathon in the world to award winners the same sum for first place for the runners up and for third place finishers organizers said they were unaware of any other major athletic event in any sport that has taken a similar step by equalizing the prize pot marathon organizers have said they hope to pave the way for other races and sporting events to offer parity encouraging more athletes to participate in disability sport and removing financial barriers to participation the parity extends to gender both male and female wheelchair athletes are eligible for equal prize amounts the men s wheelchair division race was won by marcel hug a paralympian widely considered the world s best wheelchair racer who cheered the decision ahead of the race the london marathon is setting a great and strong but also courageous example for equality and inclusion that should go beyond the world of sport and hopefully inspires in other areas too hug told nbc news hug crossed the line in one hour minutes and seconds in london to claim his fifth victory american athlete daniel romanchuk placed second behind hug in third was british wheelchair racing star david weir a six time paralympic gold medalist who s won the london race eight times before more than any other athlete swiss athlete catherine debrunne won the women s event with a time of one hour minutes and seconds manuela schar also from switzerland came in second and american tatyana mcfadden placed third third place u s athlete tatyana mcfadden winner switzerland s catherine debrunner and second place switzerland s manuela schar pose for a photo after the women s wheelchair race on sunday justin tallis afp via getty images in boston the top prize for the wheelchair division was in the open division the non disabled male and female winners took home more than three times as much the mile race in london kicked off sunday morning south of the thames river crossing over tower bridge and passing iconic london landmarks like the tower of london the london eye and the big ben before reaching the finish line near buckingham palace hugh brasher the london marathon s event director cast the move as part of an evolution toward greater inclusion for athletes with disabilities that started in when the london race held its first wheelchair event and continued with multiple international paralympic committee world championships held since then in the british capital romanchuk who grew up in maryland applauded the decision to equalize the prize structure predicting it would have huge effects beyond race day london marathon s equal prize money helps elevate perception of the sport to reflect the reality that we re professional athletes training and competing just like other professional athletes romanchuk told nbc news as he traveled to london for the race my main hope is that it brings more visibility to the sport so that more athletes with disabilities can see the possibility of having an active lifestyle and participate in community running races another reason why equalizing the financial aspect of sports is important romanchuk said is that the high cost of specialized equipment for wheelchair racing often prevents lower income athletes from getting involved he said adaptive sports equipment starts at several thousands of dollars at entry level far more than the pair of running shoes that a nondisabled athlete would need to start competing romanchuk said he d first gotten involved in adaptive sports when he was years old describing the effect it had on his development and self confidence they taught me to focus on what i did have two strong arms instead of what i didn t have said romanchuk who was born with spina bifida a congenital defect that affects the spinal cord the fact that my legs didn t work normally was never an acceptable reason why i couldn t reach a particular goal ,NBC News,Sports
33,"Time will tell if it’s another Dream Team, but the roster for the United States men’s basketball team at the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris was officially revealed Wednesday on ""TODAY.""

The men’s team has a decorated history at the Olympics, and this year’s squad is seeking to defend the gold medal that Team USA won at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

The U.S. has a stranglehold on the gold: It has won 16 gold medals and has been the top team at each Games dating back to 2004, when Argentina stunned the U.S. in the semifinals en route to claiming the gold medal.

Here’s a look at who will represent the red, white and blue in Paris, along with which team they play for in the NBA.

LeBron James — Los Angeles Lakers

Stephen Curry — Golden State Warriors

Kevin Durant — Phoenix Suns

Joel Embiid — Philadelphia 76ers

Anthony Davis — Los Angeles Lakers

Devin Booker — Phoenix Suns

Anthony Edwards — Minnesota Timberwolves

Jayson Tatum — Boston Celtics

Bam Adebayo — Miami Heat

Tyrese Haliburton — Indiana Pacers

Jrue Holiday — Boston Celtics

James will be playing in his fourth Olympics. He won a bronze medal in 2004 and gold in 2008 and 2012.

Curry, meanwhile, has enjoyed a decorated career, but this will mark his first appearance in an Olympics.

Durant has the chance to make history when he takes the court in Paris. He’s one of two players, along with Carmelo Anthony, to win three gold medals in men’s basketball, and could be the first to win a fourth.

Who will coach the team?

Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, who has led his team to four NBA titles, will man the sidelines in Paris. He was an assistant on the 2021 team that won gold in Tokyo.

When does the team play?

Here’s a look at the team’s Olympic schedule as it currently stands:

July 28 — Serbia

July 31 — South Sudan

Aug. 3 — Qualifying team from the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament that runs from July 2 until July 7 and features Mexico, Ivory Coast, Lithuania, Italy, Puerto Rico and Bahrain.

34,"The Olympic flame was lit at the birthplace of the Games in Greece on Tuesday in a ceremony rich with ancient traditions that will launch a torch relay culminating in Paris on July 26.

The flame was lit at the site of ancient Olympia and will be carried more than 3,000 miles on its way to the French capital this summer.

In ancient times the flame was lit with the energy of the sun, and it would remain lit in a sanctuary at Olympia known as the Prytaneum.

In keeping with the ancient custom, actor Mary Mina, a “high priestess,” asked the sun god Apollo for help in lighting the flame in the ruins of the temple of Hera, the wife of Zeus and queen of the gods.

The message, organizers say, also remains the same.

“The Olympic flame has been a symbol of peace and friendship among nations since antiquity,” the International Olympics Committee said.

IOC President Thomas Bach said in a speech at the ceremony, ""In these difficult times we are living through, with wars and conflicts on the rise, people are fed up with all the hate, the aggression and negative news they are facing day in and day out.""

The ceremony was planned to capture the sun’s rays with a parabolic mirror. Cloudy conditions forced Tuesday’s ceremony into plan B: using a pre-lit flame instead of relying on the gods. Organizers will hope that’s the last plan B they need to rely on.

Although it reflects Hellenic traditions dating back thousands of years, the ceremony was first conducted in its current form in 1936, when the Games were held in Berlin under the watch of Adolf Hitler.

The actions are now performed by actors, however, while a dance troupe performs choreography ""inspired by ancient times,"" the IOC said.",the olympic flame was lit at the birthplace of the games in greece on tuesday in a ceremony rich with ancient traditions that will launch a torch relay culminating in paris on july the flame was lit at the site of ancient olympia and will be carried more than miles on its way to the french capital this summer in ancient times the flame was lit with the energy of the sun and it would remain lit in a sanctuary at olympia known as the prytaneum a greek actor during the flame lighting ceremony at the ancient archeological site in olympia greece on tuesday milos bicanski getty images in keeping with the ancient custom actor mary mina a high priestess asked the sun god apollo for help in lighting the flame in the ruins of the temple of hera the wife of zeus and queen of the gods the message organizers say also remains the same the olympic flame has been a symbol of peace and friendship among nations since antiquity the international olympics committee said ioc president thomas bach said in a speech at the ceremony in these difficult times we are living through with wars and conflicts on the rise people are fed up with all the hate the aggression and negative news they are facing day in and day out the ceremony was planned to capture the sun s rays with a parabolic mirror cloudy conditions forced tuesday s ceremony into plan b using a pre lit flame instead of relying on the gods organizers will hope that s the last plan b they need to rely on although it reflects hellenic traditions dating back thousands of years the ceremony was first conducted in its current form in when the games were held in berlin under the watch of adolf hitler the actions are now performed by actors however while a dance troupe performs choreography inspired by ancient times the ioc said ,NBC News,Sports

43,"Former Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza has confirmed her retirement from tennis.

The Spanish former world number one won Wimbledon in 2017, as well as the French Open the previous year.

The 30-year-old announced her retirement in Madrid before the Laureus World Sports Awards.

""The time has come to say goodbye. It's been a long and successful career, but I feel the time is right to retire,"" said Muguruza.

Venezuela-born Muguruza has not played since January 2023, and last March said she was taking an extended break from tennis.

She turned professional in 2012 and won her first Grand Slam in 2016, defeating Serena Williams in the final of the French Open.

The following year she was victorious at Wimbledon, beating Venus Williams in the final and reaching number one in the world rankings.

""If 25 years ago when I started hitting my first tennis balls someone had told me that I would become a professional tennis player, that I would fulfil my dream of winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon, that I would become number one in the world and win the WTA Finals, I would have thought this person was crazy,"" said Muguruza.

Duplantis, 24, cleared 6.24m, one centimetre above the mark he set in last September's Diamond League final.

It was the eighth time the reigning Olympic and world champion has broken the outdoor world record.

American Sam Hendricks finished second with 5.82, while China's Bokai Huang was third with 5.72.

He's got ""God's hand on his back"" said Hendricks of Duplantis, and added: ""I've seen him from a 14-year-old come all the way up and it makes me actually ever joyous to be even just second place behind the world record holder because I know he works so darned hard.

Sainz was the subject of a protest from Aston Martin following a crash in the second session.

The Spaniard managed to return the car to the pits after losing control at the final corner and lightly hitting the barrier, and he took part in the rest of qualifying.

Aston Martin protested on the grounds of a rule that says that ""any driver whose car stops on the track during the qualifying session will not be permitted to take any further part in that session"".

Stewards ruled that as he had not received outside assistance, it was correct to allow him to continue, and the rules will be amended accordingly.

Verstappen, who has won three of the four races so far this season and retired from the other with a brake problem, said: ""We should be quick, normally.

Jenna Fischer can perform through pain.

The actress revealed she filmed the “Mean Girls” movie musical adaptation with a broken shoulder.

“It was the wildest experience,” she told People, adding that she had injured herself during a ski trip and had to hide it while filming.

“I shot for one day on ‘Mean Girls,’ and then I didn’t have to shoot for a month,” Fischer said. “And in that month I went on a ski trip and I fell on a sidewalk and I broke my shoulder.”

She continued, “So I had to shoot the rest of the movie with a very newly broken shoulder.”

“The Office” star plays Cady’s mom in the musical adaptation, and said if you look closely, she couldn’t move her right arm in the production.

“If you notice in the opening shot of the movie, I’m out in the middle of a field and Cady is singing, and I have a crossbody bag on. And I’m holding my crossbody bag,” she said. “The reason I’m doing that is because I had to take my sling off. That was serving as a sling for me.

“So if you notice in the movie I am exclusively gesturing with my left arm. It was the wildest experience,” she said. “So a big part of my role in Mean Girls was pretending I didn’t have a broken shoulder.”

Fischer added she’s doing better now, one year after the accident.

Will Smith dusted off his black suit and Ray Bans for a surprise performance at Coachella.

The actor and musician made a cameo during J Balvin’s Sunday night set at the music festival, singing his 1997 hit “Men in Black” from the film of the same name.

Smith, who starred in three “Men in Black” movies, showed up toward the end of Balvin’s extraterrestrial-themed set, sporting the iconic look that became synonymous with the alien-fighting agents in the film.

With green aliens dancing in the background, Smith sang a portion of the catchy tune and resurrected dance moves from the music video. (Balvin’s performance and Smith’s cameo were shown on Coachella’s YouTube livestream.)

Fittingly, Smith closed his performance with a reference to the movie, whipping out a memory-erasing neuralyzer and disappearing as quickly as he appeared. This was a performance, however, that attendees and live streamers alike are unlikely to forget.

In the “Men in Black” franchise, Smith starred as Agent J, a former NYPD detective who is recruited to serve in a secret organization that deals with all extraterrestrial matters. Smith starred alongside Tommy Lee Jones.

The song that accompanied the film was from Smith’s debut solo album “Big Willie Style.”

Legendary screenwriter William Goldman gave Hollywood the phrase, “Nobody knows anything,” expanding on that a decade ago in an interview in which he explained, “Nobody has the least idea what movie’s gonna work.”

Add “The Spiderwick Chronicles,” a new streaming series, to the never-released movies “Batgirl” and “Coyote vs. Acme” as evidence that studios and streaming services don’t know any more now – and indeed, may know less – about what works than they did when Goldman expressed that thought in his book “Adventures in the Screen Trade.”

Based on popular books that previously inspired a 2008 movie, “The Spiderwick Chronicles” was produced for Disney+, before, as Deadline reported, the service decided not to proceed with airing it as a cost-cutting move.

Unlike “Batgirl,” produced for Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max (a sister unit to ), and that studio’s live-action adaptation of the Roadrunner cartoons “Coyote vs. Acme,” “Spiderwick” will actually see the light of day. After Disney balked, the project was acquired by the Roku channel, which will premiere the eight-episode first season this week.

Now, “Spiderwick Chronicles” isn’t anything special, and has the generic feel of any number of similarly themed properties, this one about a family that moves into a creepy estate that’s home to mythological creatures.

Still, the cast includes Christian Slater and Charlayne Woodard, and bluntly, you’ve surely seen worse shows on Disney+, which makes one wonder why this effort was deemed unworthy.

Various factors go into that, including, in the case of “Batgirl” and “Coyote,” complicated tax issues that potentially make the savings associated with writing off a movie entirely more attractive than televising or distributing it.

At the heart of those decisions, though, is a basic decision that these projects are not going to be successful enough to merit even bothering to release them, when, in point of fact, nobody really knows.

Warner Bros. chose not to release the movie ""Batgirl,"" starring Leslie Grace in the title role. from Warner Bros/Leslie Grace/Instagram

Indeed, the long history of Hollywood is filled with unexpected hits as well as surprising flops. The studios behind “Titanic” famously feared that James Cameron’s over-budget epic was going to sink faster than the actual ocean liner did. “Seinfeld” was given so little chance of succeeding at NBC the network’s head of specials, Rick Ludwin, had to give up a portion of his budget to greenlight a mere four episodes, and the rest, as they say, is history.

Goldman died in 2018, leaving behind a glittering resume that included screenplays for “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “All the President’s Men,” “Marathon Man” and “The Princess Bride.” While those signature works came during a different era, the broader lessons about the corner-office mentality have surely lingered.

The current, unsettled status of the entertainment landscape, roiled by the shaky economics of streaming and the blow dealt box-office revenue by at-home consumption and Covid, have fueled unease about how companies spend money. Even once sure-fire commodities, like Marvel, suddenly look like rolls of the dice.

Nevertheless, a genuine hit – the next “Barbie” or Avatar,” or in streaming, another “Stranger Things” or “The Boys” – is a bargain at practically any price.

Roku might know something that Disney doesn’t, or vice versa. Or perhaps it’s just that “Spiderwick,” a recognizable title, could serve the interests of a lower-profile channel better than Disney, which wants to showcase properties the studio owns. In the glass-half-full department, this could be one of those instances where the resolution benefits all sides, the producers and talent included.

One of Goldman’s famous lines came in “All the President’s Men,” in which Deep Throat says, “Follow the money.” With projects like “Batgirl” and “Spiderwick,” though, that’s an elusive trail, suggesting that modern adventures in the screen trade – large and small – have become more confounding than even a sage like Goldman could have envisioned.

The fortuitous timing of having a series produced by and featuring newly minted Oscar-winner Robert Downey Jr. tumbles down a very strange rabbit hole in “The Sympathizer,” a darkly satirical look at the Vietnam War and its aftermath. Playing no less than four roles, Downey stands in for multiple ugly Americans, but the series descends into a narrative quagmire and, despite powerful moments, can’t consistently pull itself out.

Directed in part by acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “Decision to Leave”), who oversees the show with writer Don McKellar, the seven-episode limited series is adapted from Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Each episode begins with dated-looking credits that evoke the 1970s, a promising Quentin Tarantino-ish conceit that, given what follows, sets expectations too high.

Told in flashback, and frequently rewinding to fill in details, the story focuses on the Captain (Hoa Xuande), a half-Vietnamese, half-French officer of the secret police who has surreptitiously been working for the North Vietnamese against the American-backed government.

The Captain’s lineage, and his double life, are emblematic of a man torn in different directions, which includes his relationship with two inseparable friends (played by Duy Nguyen and Fred Nguyen Khan). As constructed, it’s a rather heavy-handed approximation of the fate Vietnam experienced in the pull of the war, which doesn’t make the Captain’s increasingly surreal arc any more compelling.

That’s because the protagonist is relating his story to a Vietnamese interrogator, recounting a journey that includes the fall of Saigon, fleeing the country – in what’s surely the show’s most harrowing sequence – and his curious adventures in the US.

As for Downey, his various guises include everything from a CIA agent to a crazed movie director, a device that proves every bit as gimmicky, and for the most part unnecessary, as that sounds. The net effect is less Peter Sellers in “Dr. Strangelove,” assuming that was the intent, than a means of maximizing the star’s presence without really heightening its impact.

The Captain’s travels also brings him into contact with an American coworker (Sandra Oh) whose experience dealing with their racist boss comes in handy, and in perhaps the strangest detour, onto a movie set where he serves as a technical consultant, subject to the whims of Downey’s aforementioned director and an insane method actor (David Duchovny).

“The Sympathizer” is hardly the first project to funnel the contradictions of the Vietnam War through an exaggerated lens (“Apocalypse Now” being a prime example), but except for a few bracing sequences the execution only clouds that vision. The high hurdle of balancing the satirical tone seems especially noteworthy coming on the heels of “The Regime,” another splashy HBO production that similarly proved too cute and coy for its own good.

Credit Downey with leveraging his commercial clout to champion such challenging material and attract a marquee international director to American television, but in the final analysis, “The Sympathizer” plays like the latest instance of indulging a star’s pet project.

While there’s an obvious rationale for that strategy in the attention-oriented realm of premium TV, given that the series doesn’t match the promise its high-profile elements would suggest, sympathy isn’t one of them.

President Joe Biden on Saturday signed a bill that reauthorizes a key surveillance authority after the Senate passed the legislation late Friday night, avoiding a lapse in the controversial program.

Lawmakers voted 60-34 for the bill to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act after the House passed the measure late last week.

The House passed the bill after a new version was put forward for a two-year reauthorization instead of five years, a change that helped appease conservatives who had initially revolted against the legislation. A two-year reauthorization would give former President Donald Trump a chance to overhaul the law if he wins the upcoming presidential election.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan applauded the reauthorization, calling the program “one of the United States’ most vital intelligence collection tools.”

Congress had been up against a Friday deadline after authority for Section 702 was extended through that date as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.

Whether Congress would avert the lapse remained in question earlier in the day as senators struggled to reach a deal to renew the key intelligence community surveillance tool.

Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had told lawmakers to be prepared to work over the weekend, but by Friday evening, locked in a negotiated agreement to vote. “All day long we persisted and persisted and persisted in hopes of reaching a breakthrough, and I’m glad we got it done,” the New York Democrat said, referencing the stalled negotiations that threatened the program.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also pressed for passage of the FISA bill, which he said had a number of changes in it to address past “abuses” by the FBI. The Kentucky Republican also warned that some critics of the bill were “fear mongering” that the legislation would allow spying on Americans in coffees shops and other places and should be ignored.

Supporters argue Section 702 is a critical tool for safeguarding national security, but it has come under scrutiny from some lawmakers over alleged misuse.

Under FISA’s Section 702, the government hoovers up massive amounts of internet and cell phone data on foreign targets. Hundreds of thousands of Americans’ information is incidentally collected during that process and then accessed each year without a warrant — down from millions of such queries the US government ran in past years. Critics refer to these queries as “backdoor” searches.

The trove of data, including a large portion of US internet traffic, is meant to provide US intelligence agencies with quick access to data regarding foreigners in other countries.

According to one assessment, it forms the basis of most of the intelligence the president views each morning and it has helped the US keep tabs on Russia’s intentions in Ukraine, identify foreign efforts to access US infrastructure, uncover foreign terror networks and thwart terror attacks in the US.

The complicated politics surrounding the law have long united strange bedfellows: Some conservative Republicans have joined forces with progressive Democrats to push for reforms to the authority, while security-focused Democrats and Republicans have opposed major new restrictions.

On Friday, senators argued over an amendment that would require the intelligence community to get court warrants for spying. The program is currently warrantless, in large part because it is aimed at foreigners not Americans, but US citizens do get swept up in the surveillance when they are interacting with targets abroad. A similar amendment failed in the House, but on a tied vote.

Another amendment at issue was from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the Intelligence Committee. His amendment, which was co-sponsored by several of the most liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans in the chamber, would strike a new part of the program that he argued would lead every day Americans into helping the government spy if they have “access to equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store wire or electronic communications.”

Last week, in a setback for House GOP leadership, a group of conservatives initially revolted against the bill and brought down a key procedural vote after Trump called on Republicans to “KILL FISA” in a post on Truth Social.

That move threw the fate of the measure into question, but leadership ultimately steered a modified version of the surveillance bill to final passage.

Attorney General Merrick Garland on Saturday praised the bill’s passage, saying it will help keep the country safe.

“This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the United States the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans’ privacy and civil liberties,” Garland said.

Former Spice Girl and current business mogul Victoria Beckham turns 50 today, and as she barrels forward into a new decade she leaves in her wake five — each filled to the brim with some unforgettable fashion. In her earlier years, when she wasn’t planning matching outfits with husband and ex-England footballer David Beckham, Victoria was demanding her own spotlight with chainmail tops, burberry headscarves and pink croc leather Birkin bags.

Her image shifted in 2008 after she launched her eponymous fashion brand, which has since shown regularly at London, New York and Paris Fashion Weeks. Gone were the days of uber-sexy Spice Girl styling — and also smiling, which she gave up in “responsibility to the fashion community,” she told Vogue in 2015. Instead, Victoria’s tastes evolved into chic tailoring — from billowing shirts to sharp flares, often in vibrant hues, and invariably topped with a pair of enormous black-out shades. While her wardrobe today tends to skew more subtle, there’s still nothing Victoria can’t style out — including, most recently, a pair of crutches to support her broken ankle.

As I get ready to step into 50 (in heels, of course!), I feel so incredibly blessed to have reached this milestone,” Victoria wrote on Instagram. “I believe that you can be many things. A pop star, a mother, a wife, a designer… My passion has always been to dream big, then dream even bigger! Believe in yourself first — everyone else will follow.”

In honour of the fashion titan’s big day, we take a look back on some of her most memorable looks.

On the whirlwind night that saw the stars of the most-watched season of women’s college basketball officially move forward to their professional careers, players stepped out in style in sumptuous gowns and smart tailoring, elevating the WNBA draft into a full-on fashion event.

And while Caitlin Clark, the NCAA’s all-time leading scorer across men’s and women’s basketball, was snapped up as the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever, another brand had already made a move to bring her into its circle: Prada, who dressed her for the event.

Wearing an unbuttoned satin shirt and mini skirt combo with a rhinestone mesh crop top, shades and black pumps, the former Iowa Hawkeyes point guard became the first basketball player to be dressed by the luxury label for draft night. (Though, in a relatable swap, she was photographed in Uggs hours later during a post-draft interview.)

In previous years, dress codes at the draft had tended to lean toward daytime suiting and dresses, but on Monday night it was clear that the stakes had been raised.

Stanford’s Cameron Brink, who was drafted to the Los Angeles Sparks, arrived in a black-and-white high-slit Balmain gown; Tennessee’s Rickea Jackson, who will join Brink in LA, opted for a red pantsuit with floating illusion sleeves and a side train. South Carolina’s Kamilla Cardoso, who helped earn her team the championship at the end of an undefeated season, wore a plunging red suit. Both she and LSU’s Angel Reese, who sparkled in a hooded design by Bronx and Banco, will head to the Chicago Sky.

Prada’s move to dress Clark is likely a sign of luxury brands’ further expansion into the sport. While sportswear brands have always vied for judicious partnerships with elite athletes, the basketball court has also increasingly become the domain of high fashion labels, with NBA players’ pre-game entrances, called “tunnel walks,” becoming runways of their own.

And with more eyes eagerly watching women’s basketball — Clark, Cardoso, Reese and their peers helped attract record-breaking TV audiences this past year to the NCAA, while the WNBA enjoyed its most-watched season in more than two decades — the time is ripe for more high-end labels to stake their claim.

Earlier this year, stylist Jazmine Motley-Maddox, who dresses WNBA teammates and power couple DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas, commented on the shift among professional female athletes to The Cut, saying: “I don’t think before, especially in the WNBA, girls were hiring stylists to dress them to go to the game. Designer brands now jump at the chance because they know this will be publicized, styled, and shown to millions.”

Ahead of the draft, Clark called her collaboration with Prada “pretty special,” in a red-carpet interview (though, technically, said carpet was orange-colored) with the WNBA.

“I think the biggest thing is I’m just very lucky to be in this moment,” she told  at the event, reflecting back on the past two months.

“When things might get tiring or you have to do stuff, I think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity. This isn’t something everybody gets to do,” she added. “It’s once in a lifetime, and (I’m) just trying to soak in every single experience.”", on the whirlwind night that saw the stars of the most watched season of women s college basketball officially move forward to their professional careers players stepped out in style in sumptuous gowns and smart tailoring elevating the wnba draft into a full on fashion event and while caitlin clark the ncaa s all time leading scorer across men s and women s basketball was snapped up as the no overall pick by the indiana fever another brand had already made a move to bring her into its circle prada who dressed her for the event wearing an unbuttoned satin shirt and mini skirt combo with a rhinestone mesh crop top shades and black pumps the former iowa hawkeyes point guard became the first basketball player to be dressed by the luxury label for draft night though in a relatable swap she was photographed in uggs hours later during a post draft interview clark in a satin two piece prada look with a rhinestone crop top underneath sarah stier getty images in previous years dress codes at the draft had tended to lean toward daytime suiting and dresses but on monday night it was clear that the stakes had been raised stanford s cameron brink who was drafted to the los angeles sparks arrived in a black and white high slit balmain gown tennessee s rickea jackson who will join brink in la opted for a red pantsuit with floating illusion sleeves and a side train south carolina s kamilla cardoso who helped earn her team the championship at the end of an undefeated season wore a plunging red suit both she and lsu s angel reese who sparkled in a hooded design by bronx and banco will head to the chicago sky angel reese in a backless hooded gown sarah stier getty images rickea jackson in a playful high low pantsuit sarah stier getty images prada s move to dress clark is likely a sign of luxury brands further expansion into the sport while sportswear brands have always vied for judicious partnerships with elite athletes the basketball court has also increasingly become the domain of high fashion labels with nba players pre game entrances called tunnel walks becoming runways of their own and with more eyes eagerly watching women s basketball clark cardoso reese and their peers helped attract record breaking tv audiences this past year to the ncaa while the wnba enjoyed its most watched season in more than two decades the time is ripe for more high end labels to stake their claim earlier this year stylist jazmine motley maddox who dresses wnba teammates and power couple dewanna bonner and alyssa thomas commented on the shift among professional female athletes to the cut saying i don t think before especially in the wnba girls were hiring stylists to dress them to go to the game designer brands now jump at the chance because they know this will be publicized styled and shown to millions ahead of the draft clark called her collaboration with prada pretty special in a red carpet interview though technically said carpet was orange colored with the wnba i think the biggest thing is i m just very lucky to be in this moment she told at the event reflecting back on the past two months when things might get tiring or you have to do stuff i think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity this isn t something everybody gets to do she added it s once in a lifetime and i m just trying to soak in every single experience ,CNN,Fashion

Romance was in the air at London’s St. Pancras station on Tuesday, and not just because burgeoning power couple Dua Lipa and actor Callum Turner were spotted returning from a trip to Paris.

Beyond their similar leather jackets, there was something nostalgic, even sentimental about their looks. Lipa, carrying a black Hermés bag adorned with a tangled assortment of keychains, a checkerboard claw hair clip and a Hermès Twilly scarf, seemed to be taking cues from another clutter connoisseur — the late Jane Birkin.

Turner wheeled a silver Rimowa cabin case decked out with a smorgasbord of luggage stickers. From afar, the pair could have been mistaken for travelers from the 1960s (though Lipa’s cherry Coke-colored tresses and Puma sneakers slightly give the game away), wistfully accruing mementos and keepsakes from trips abroad.

The fashion for luggage patches began around the 1900s — they were typically offered by grand, palatial hotels. Neil Mockford/GC Images/Getty Images

Luggage patches not dissimilar to the ones stickers spotted on Turner’s case emerged in the 1900s, where they were typically offered by grand, palatial hotels such as the Hotel Sole in Palermo, Italy; or the Hotel Europa in Costa Rica. Inspired by the travel posters of the time, an artfully designed sticker was free advertising for an establishment when slapped across a stylish guest’s case, and enabled the traveler to signpost to their prestigious holidaying habits.

“In this age of nostalgia… I say bring back the travel sticker,” wrote the New York Times in 1971, insisting that the colorful decorations are key to evoking pleasant memories and standing out from the crowd. Birkin herself confessed her melting pot of bag charms were part of an expression of individuality. “There’s no fun in a bag if it’s not kicked around,” she told Vogue in 2011, “I always put on stickers and beads and worry-beads. You can get them from Greece, Israel, Palestine — from anywhere in the world. I always hang things on my bags because I don’t like them looking like everyone else’s.”

If it wasn’t for the fact she was signing autographs outside the CBS studio in New York, many would have thought Billie Piper was attempting to go unnoticed. Like an old Hollywood film star caught on the fly, Piper was photographed on Tuesday evening in a pair of oval sunglasses with her head shrouded in a black triangle scarf — pulled back just enough to reveal a glimpse of her romantic copper-colored waves.

Julia Fox got the memo, too, on the same day styling hers with sports-mode sunglasses and a pin-curled ‘do in the shade of Velveeta cheese (literally).

Wrapped, folded or tied under the chin; the headscarf is perhaps one of the most diverse — and historic — accessories in fashion’s arsenal.

They can be a sign of faith, first introduced in some religious texts around the 13th century BC; or simply used to shield from the sun, as was the case in ancient Mesopotamian societies. Centuries later, following the Women’s Suffrage movement, fabric wrapped twice and tied at the crown of the head became known in the West as the working woman’s headscarf — protecting women’s hair as they entered the factory workforce during World War II.

Hermès — a brand whose Twilly scarf is still favored today by the likes of Dua Lipa and Olivia Palermo — released its first silk scarf in 1937 with a horse and carriage design printed using intricate woodblocks.

Beloved by the late Queen Elizabeth II, Hermès’ patterned silk squares became a defining feature of off-duty royal dressing, nicknamed the Sloane Ranger style after a combination of the 1949 western TV show “The Lone Ranger” and London’s affluent Sloane Square. The appeal was felt across the pond, and was soon picked up by first lady Jackie Onassis, who wore her scarves everywhere from airport terminals to the top deck of boats, and Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco — who once used her Hermès scarf as a sling for her broken arm.

It seems even brands themselves are keen to revisit these halcyon days of chic headgear. At the Givenchy Fall-Winter 2024 menswear show in Paris this January, the house revived a series of trompe-l’œil headscarf designs first debuted by Hubert de Givenchy in 1953. Sewn under the chin with the corners laid flat like a collar, each was etched with a different hairstyle. Meanwhile, flora and dramatic black headscarves were key features of the Spring-Summer 2024 runways at Copenhagen Fashion Week, while at Burberry’s latest show in London they appeared in classic tartan designs, peeking out from under heavy leather coats.

Piper — who is in the middle of promoting her new Netflix drama “Scoop,” a recount of the infamous 2019 BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew — is returning to our screens for the first time in a year and a half. “I don’t work a lot for a few reasons,” she told Vogue writer Giles Hattersley last month, who described her as “touchingly nervous” to hear reactions to the project. “I don’t like being away from my kids, and I don’t like much that I read.” But even if Piper is evermore camera-shy, she is seemingly never — particularly when wearing a headscarf and shades — not camera-ready.",editor s note featuring the good the bad and the ugly look of the week is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days if it wasn t for the fact she was signing autographs outside the cbs studio in new york many would have thought billie piper was attempting to go unnoticed like an old hollywood film star caught on the fly piper was photographed on tuesday evening in a pair of oval sunglasses with her head shrouded in a black triangle scarf pulled back just enough to reveal a glimpse of her romantic copper colored waves julia fox got the memo too on the same day styling hers with sports mode sunglasses and a pin curled do in the shade of velveeta cheese literally wrapped folded or tied under the chin the headscarf is perhaps one of the most diverse and historic accessories in fashion s arsenal the same day julia fox was spotted in another headscarf styled with her velveeta cheese curls and chunky boots rachpoot bauer griffin gc images getty images they can be a sign of faith first introduced in some religious texts around the th century bc or simply used to shield from the sun as was the case in ancient mesopotamian societies centuries later following the women s suffrage movement fabric wrapped twice and tied at the crown of the head became known in the west as the working woman s headscarf protecting women s hair as they entered the factory workforce during world war ii hermès a brand whose twilly scarf is still favored today by the likes of dua lipa and olivia palermo released its first silk scarf in with a horse and carriage design printed using intricate woodblocks beloved by the late queen elizabeth ii hermès patterned silk squares became a defining feature of off duty royal dressing nicknamed the sloane ranger style after a combination of the western tv show the lone ranger and london s affluent sloane square the appeal was felt across the pond and was soon picked up by first lady jackie onassis who wore her scarves everywhere from airport terminals to the top deck of boats and grace kelly princess of monaco who once used her hermès scarf as a sling for her broken arm headscarves have been around for centuries from ancient civilizations to the british royals piper wore hers with an all black dolce gabbana suit rw mediapunch ipx ap it seems even brands themselves are keen to revisit these halcyon days of chic headgear at the givenchy fall winter menswear show in paris this january the house revived a series of trompe l œil headscarf designs first debuted by hubert de givenchy in sewn under the chin with the corners laid flat like a collar each was etched with a different hairstyle meanwhile flora and dramatic black headscarves were key features of the spring summer runways at copenhagen fashion week while at burberry s latest show in london they appeared in classic tartan designs peeking out from under heavy leather coats piper who is in the middle of promoting her new netflix drama scoop a recount of the infamous bbc newsnight interview with prince andrew is returning to our screens for the first time in a year and a half i don t work a lot for a few reasons she told vogue writer giles hattersley last month who described her as touchingly nervous to hear reactions to the project i don t like being away from my kids and i don t like much that i read but even if piper is evermore camera shy she is seemingly never particularly when wearing a headscarf and shades not camera ready ,CNN,Fashion
55,"Tokyo, Japan  —

Tokyo Fashion Week concluded perhaps its most successful edition since the Covid-19 pandemic, with more international guests and buyers returning to Japan’s capital for the Fall-Winter 2024 edition.

The event’s 35 physical shows featured Finnish brand Marimekko and a selection of Canadian designers, though the schedule largely comprised local brands. Up-and-coming labels were joined on the program by mainstays of Japanese fashion, like Mikio Sakabe. And the week closed out in style on Saturday, as Anrealage — the futuristic label that famously dressed Beyoncé in a “color-changing” gown for her “Renaissance” tour — debuted its menswear brand on home soil.

In recent decades, Japan has struggled to produce designers as prominent as the likes of Yohji Yamamoto or the late Issey Miyake and Hanae Mori — figures who helped take the country’s fashion global in the 1970s and 1980s. But attendees were upbeat about the state of the local scene.

Outside Japanese label Support Surface’s runway show on Friday, guest Yu Masui welcomed the event’s championing of young designers.

“I’m excited to see what young people wear,” he said, wearing a Christopher Kane kilt over Dries Van Noten jeans. “Independent designers are taking off now too compared to the ‘90s and early 2000s, when fast fashion brands like H&M and Uniqlo became popular… The new and creativeness is coming back now.”

The event, which is currently known as Rakuten Fashion Week Tokyo, is also known for its bold street style, with guests seen sporting everything from gothic chic to quirky Lolita-style fashion.

“Japanese people’s style is amazing,” said attendee and model Yunna Badova, who wore a selection of vintage items from Russia. “Every person in Japan has their own style.”

56,"Editor’s Note:  Style is one of the official media partners of Paris Fashion Week. See all coverage here.

Paris  —

Although Paris Fashion Week is usually the talk of the town — and every social network — this week the French capital was preoccupied with events more notable than clothing.

In an historical vote on Monday — a few days ahead of International Women’s Day (March 8) — the French parliament enshrined the right to abortion into its constitution, the first country in the world to do so. As runway shows popped up in every neighborhood, hundreds also gathered at the city’s famed Trocadero in front of the Eiffel Tower, to follow the historic event on giant screens.

Paris has been a theater of style and politics for decades, so it is intriguing to note the revival of late 60s fashion this week. Indeed, this season’s Saint Laurent show revived many aspects of the founder’s 1968 collections (which can currently be admired at the Saint Laurent Museum in the French capital) featuring thinly — but colorfully — veiled nudity. A sartorial manifestation of sexual freedom that coincided with the student revolts of May 1968 where women fought notably for reproductive rights — then, and now again.

So if clothing embodies needs, desires and progress, what can be deduced from this week’s garments, shown at a time and place when sexual agency is once again taking center stage?

On runways, the women conjured seemed to thrive towards new realities, possibilities and celebrations. Japanese label Undercover dedicated its collection to working mothers, as models marched with bags filled with groceries to the sound of a poem by movie director Wim Wenders, “Watching a working woman.” Balmain’s was an ode to older women, Ester Manas focused on women of all sizes, whilst Nina Ricci highlighted sexually emancipated gender roles. The Parisienne’s static archetype seemed to embrace less normative, narrow ideals towards a wider scope of lifestyles and choices.

The week, all seemed possible — even living your life as a Kate Moss lookalike, as model Denise Ohnona showed when she fooled paparazzi and social media users alike as she marched down the Marine Serre runway. The sky’s the limit.

Retro revivals

If revivals and historical citations always come carrying reinvigorated meanings, this season’s love affair with retro chic was no exception.

Rochas’s first collection by Alessandro Vigilante delved into the house’s 1930s archives. Presented in a boudoir-like setting, old-school glamour was on display. Think technicolor lace, satin lingerie, froissé (mussed up) velvet indoor pieces – as a way to tie back to “one’s imagination and to anticipate women’s desires” said the designer after the presentation, offering indulgent rather than flashy luxury.

Chanel’s show was steeped into Deauville references, the French beach resort in Normandy where Coco first set foot in 1913. The seaside-inspired collection featured pinned up floppy hats, soft knitted suits and loose embroidered tweed, celebrating a sense of freedom of movement and mobility.

As for Chemena Kamali’s debut for Chloé, the show cited the house’s early years in the 1970s, with flouncy blouses, sheer ruffled dresses and dangling golden jewelry merged with post-Y2K boho chic (Sienna Miller sat front row witnessing her own revival). For Kamali, this sought to communicate a message of unfiltered liberty and beauty. “I want to honor the forward-thinking spirit that Gaby Aghion pioneered when she founded the house more than 70 years ago,” she said in the show notes. “She wanted to liberate women and empower them to be daring and feel free.”

Intergenerational chic

Moving away from a seemingly never-ending “kidulthood” ideal, older models sported all looks and genres, from the techno-infused at Balenciaga to dishevelled punky tailoring at Ottolinger, proving there is no age barrier to embracing subcultural trends.

“Age is not something I think of, or which defines (my) woman’s style - to me she stands out by her attitude, her singularity, her eccentricity’’ said designer Charles de Vilmorin about his eponymous ready-to-wear debut, made of arabesque-adorned silk pieces.

Are heritage houses targeting mothers and daughters through one same collection? At Loewe — like at Rabanne — the playful use of tartan could be read both as a simultaneous wink to heritage and grunge. At Dior, twisted classics — a trench-coat, but make it cropped, in leopard print, or splattered with the words “Miss Dior”— seemed to be both referencing Jackie O and Gossip Girl.

The rise of ‘Les People’

Traditionally, showing interest in celebrities (“Les people” in Parisian slang) was a big no-no amongst the proudly snobby French fashion press. Yet, this season more than ever before, the true show was very much on the front row: Salma Hayek and Kim Kardashian chatting away at Balenciaga; Naomi Campbell and Penelope Cruz catching up at Chanel; Hari Nef, Emily Ratajkowski and Charli XCX striking a pose, seemed to be part of the spectacle itself. Not forgetting the K-pop stars gathering hordes of fans outside venues.

It is a trend that points to a total shift in the French media landscape. Alexandre Maras, deputy editor-in-chief and head of social media of leading celebrity magazine Gala (its TikTok account amasses over 10m followers) said “editors once were reluctant to integrate celebrities in their coverage, but today, post-pandemic and with the rise of TikTok, every single title documents (a star’s) presence as it drives the most traffic. It has led the way to other celebrities, social media stars, sports players, and has changed the way we think of fame, and who we consider famous.”

Designing for the 1%

Pulling away from meme-like fashion that has ruled runways and TikTok alike, the quiet luxury movement continues apace.

The Row’s show had a “no phones” policy. Debates on-line didn’t miss the point: What was it really about, discretion or elitism? Victoria Beckham entered a more conceptual, sculptural design phase that is anything but Insta-baiting. From Hermès to Carven’s debut by Louise Trotter or Dries Van Noten, the focus was on elevated minimalism for discreetly opulent wardrobes.

“There is a sense that fashion is re-centering on ultra-luxury customers with private salon (events), (increased) discretion and private offers, inspired by the couture tradition of yesteryear,” said Sophie Abriat, fashion journalist at Le Monde newspaper’s magazine, M. “There is a return to classical, hushed opulence, suggesting a pre-21st century, ladylike Parisienne with a focus on quality’’ she added about wardrobes fit for only a few lifestyles and budgets.

Sexy — not to say nude — was also part of the agenda, as Valentino, Saint Laurent and Givenchy opted for entirely sheer, dramatic formal evening wear. Clothing for women who needn’t worry about public transport.

At Saint Laurent, sheer fabrics and sexy cuts seemed uniquely designed for the woman traversing around in a private car. Saint Laurent

Creativity as the ultimate luxury

And then there is Creativity with a capital C, not only as displayed in the clothes, but everywhere else. “The creative part, (including) the set design, is the most luxurious part (of the show). Luxury is scarcity, it is something rare. And creativity is rare right now,” said Balenciaga creative director Demna after the show. With invites consisting of individually thrifted presents sent to guests, the collection was bathed in a soundtrack by musician (and husband) BFRND and featured floor-to-ceiling screens.

At Acne, architectural molded dresses marched through a dystopian decor by Estonian artist and scupltor Vilu Jaanisoo made from recycled tires to accompany a collection quoting punk and S&M — fit for an art gallery as much as a red carpet.

Floor-to-ceiling screens provided a sensory overload at Balenciaga. Balenciaga

At Courrèges, the futuristic, deconstructed silhouettes circled around an inflated decor that appeared to breathe, co-created by set designer Rémy Brière, label artistic director Nicolas Di Felice, and creative studio Matière Noire. In creating these “moments,” shows become bespoke art performances, an unique experience that brings an added value for people present.

Fashion for women who multitask

“Form follows function,” architect Louis Sullivan wrote in 1886, and this guideline for designers has not lost its power to inspire.

Today, that means understanding the daily needs of women as a starting point to innovation. At Marine Serre, stretchy night-meets-day bodycon pieces, complete with pizza boxes and a caddy as runway accessories, suggest clothes that follow various emergencies and cravings, round the clock.

Baby slings were also among some of the pieces that spoke to Serre's consideration of a woman's potential daily needs. Justin Shin/Marine Serre

All best illustrated by McQueen, and Seán McGirr’s debut, who shuffled the archetypes, volumes and roles a woman might play within a day. And at Off-White, creative director Ib Kamara’s working woman, global and ageless, came with faux fur, maximalism, in playful, hybrid cuts, breaking boundaries, expectations and labels. Something familiar to Nicolas Ghesquière, who blew out his 10th candle as the head of Louis Vuitton — marking a decade of a fashion both futuristic and steeped in ancestral savoir-faire, as ubiquitous as its monogram. For busy women, multitasking women, women who can.

USA Basketball unveiled the player roster Wednesday for the men’s team that will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Three years after the Tokyo Olympics saw several of top US players sit out the Games in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2024 edition of the “Dream Team” will once again feature a roster loaded with future hall of famers and many of basketball’s brightest young stars.

The team will be anchored by Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, making his fourth appearance after skipping the past two Olympics.

The 39-year-old James has previously brought home two gold medals (2008, 2012) and a bronze (2004).

James will be joined by his Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry, the Phoenix Suns’ Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, the Boston Celtics’ Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday, Anthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Los Angeles Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard, Tyrese Haliburton of the Indiana Pacers and the Miami Heat’s Bam Adebayo.

This will be the 36-year-old Curry’s first Olympic Games, making him the fifth player to represent the Warriors at an Olympics with Team USA.

The squad will also feature Philadelphia 76ers’ big man and reigning NBA MVP Joel Embiid, who has decided to make his Olympic debut competing for the US.

Embiid could have chosen to play for his native Cameroon or France.

The team’s head coach will be Golden State’s Steve Kerr, who takes over the role from Gregg Popovich, who led Team USA to gold in the Tokyo Games.

The US team will hold a training camp and exhibition games in Las Vegas in July, before traveling to Paris.

The 2023-24 NBA regular season is officially in the books.

All 30 teams were in action on Sunday, with postseason permutations changing right up until the 82nd game of the year. Sixteen out of 20 playoff and play-in seeds were still up for grabs entering the final day of the campaign, including an unprecedented three-way battle for the top spot in the Western Conference.

The Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets all began Sunday with a 56-25 record, marking the first time in league history that three teams, through 81 games, all had the same record and a chance to capture the No. 1 seed in their conference.

OKC eventually came out on top, demolishing a depleted Dallas Mavericks squad – playing without eight rotation players – by 49 points to seal top spot.

“We all know what got us to this point,” star point guard and MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said postgame. “Just doubling down on that and keeping our heads down and trusting the work. We got this far for a reason; just don’t veer off of it.”

The reigning champion Nuggets were also victorious on the final day, defeating the Memphis Grizzlies 126-111 on the road as eight players finished in double figures, but Denver has to settle for the No. 2 seed as the Thunder hold the tie-breaker based on the head-to-head record between the two teams this season.

The Timberwolves were the only one of the top-three seeds in the West to lose their last game, falling 125-106 to the Phoenix Suns in what ironically turned out to be a playoff series preview. The loss locked Minnesota into the third seed, meaning that the T-Wolves will battle the sixth-placed Suns in round one of the postseason.

Much attention will be on the series between No. 4 seed Los Angeles Clippers and the No. 5 Dallas Mavericks, which will pit Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and James Harden against the elite duo of Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving.

The Thunder and Nuggets’ first-round opponents are yet to be confirmed. The NBA Play-In tournament allows the four teams ranked seventh through 10th at the end of the regular season the opportunity to compete for the final two spots in each conference’s playoff bracket.

LeBron James and the eighth-placed LA Lakers will take on the New Orleans Pelicans on the road for the right to battle Denver in the playoffs – the loser of that game will then face the winner of the No. 9 and No. 10 matchup between the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors, with a shot at the No. 8 seed and a series versus OKC on the line.

Not so wild East

Meanwhile, things were slightly less complicated at the top of the East. The 64-18 Boston Celtics hold the NBA’s best record and finished 14 games ahead of their nearest challenger atop the conference. They sealed the No. 1 seed in March and await the outcome of the Play-In tournament.

There was still much postseason shuffling elsewhere in the East, however. Most notably, the New York Knicks secured a 50-win season and the No. 2 seed by beating the Chicago Bulls 120-119 in overtime. Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo incredibly played over 52 minutes in the marathon game at Madison Square Garden, while his backcourt teammate Jalen Brunson led all scorers with 40 on the night.

With the victory, New York secured its best record in 11 years, per the NBA.

“You don’t have to wind these guys up and that’s what I love about them,” said head coach Tom Thibodeau. “Sometimes, we’re not going to be perfect, we’ll make some mistakes, but they’re going to compete and I think that’s important.”

The Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers each entered the final day of the season with a chance to clinch the No. 2 seed. However, Milwaukee fell to the Orlando Magic while Cleveland was defeated by the struggling Charlotte Hornets, leaving them in third and fourth respectively.

The Bucks will face the No. 6 Indiana Pacers and the Cavs will play the No. 5 Magic – both Indiana and Orlando avoided the Play-In on the final day.

The Miami Heat, last year’s Finals runner-up, finished eighth in the standings and will visit the Philadelphia 76ers for the chance to take on the Knicks in round one. Miami, led by prolific playoff performer Jimmy Butler, was forced to come through the Play-In last year en route to the Finals as the eighth seed and will be hoping that this season’s team can replicate those heroics.

The loser of that game will face the winner of the Bulls and Atlanta Hawks matchup for the final spot in the East and a series against the Celtics.

The Golden State Warriors edged past the Portland Trail Blazers 100-92 and are now tied on a 45-35 record with the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers as the NBA regular season winds down to its final two games.

The Warriors held a narrow one-point lead over the struggling Blazers going into the fourth quarter but pulled away down the stretch behind a team-high 22 points from Steph Curry.

It was a tough shooting night for the two-time MVP, who shot just 36.4% from the floor, but he got it done elsewhere by adding eight assists, seven rebounds, two blocks and a steal.

“You know they’re going to play hard and with a lot of energy, and for the most part, it worked for about 42 minutes, but we just got really disciplined down the stretch, had great point of attack defense,” Curry said, per ESPN.

“We just competed and that last six minutes was hard-nosed basketball. That’s what it took to win.”

Deandre Ayton scored a game-high 25 points for Portland to go with 11 rebounds, while rookie Scoot Henderson continued his late season improvement with 18 points and 12 assists.

It was Henderson’s eighth game of the season with double-digit assists, the most of any rookie in the NBA.

The Warriors are in a thrilling Play-In race. Troy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Sports/Reuters

The Warriors appear to have caught the winning bug at just the right time with their third straight victory, while the Kings and Lakers have both lost two on the bounce.

After a huge 135-123 win at Sacramento on Thursday, the New Orleans Pelicans currently sit in the sixth and final automatic playoff spot, one game ahead of the Phoenix Suns in seventh as both teams desperately try and avoid the Play-In Tournament.

In what should be a thrilling end to the season, the Pelicans will travel to Golden State before ending their campaign at home to the Lakers, while the Suns’ final two games are away versus the Kings and the No. 2 seeded Minnesota Timberwolves.

After the Warriors host the Pelicans on Friday, Steve Kerr’s team will then welcome the No. 12 seed Utah Jazz in its season finale.

“It’s a loaded conference. Everybody’s good,” Kerr said. “It’s just tough to make up ground.”

60,"They still have the final stretch in front of them, but it feels like Luton are running out of runway. Yoane Wissa’s double, headers from Ethan Pinnock and Keane Lewis-Potter, and a late strike from Kevin Schade left their hosts a point from safety with four games to play.

While Rob Edwards, the Luton manager, refused to be drawn into talk of must-win games before the match, nor did he seek to downplay the significance of this fixture. His players knew that, with Everton hosting Nottingham Forest on Sunday, a win would lift them out of the relegation zone and ratchet up the pressure on their nearest rivals.

Brentford arrived on the back of a four-match unbeaten run, their longest since the opening four games of the season. If easing their own relegation fears had reduced their sense of urgency, they did not let it show: they went after Luton in the early stages, pressing them into several mistakes in possession including one that allowed Mikkel Damsgaard to thread through Lewis-Potter to fire wide.

Luton responded with an attempted counterpunch, Alfie Doughty testing Mark Flekken from a tight angle after a whirlwind attack. The game began to swing like a pendulum: Sergio Reguilón worked the space out wide on the left before curling a cross to the back post, where Lewis-Potter’s close-range header was saved by Thomas Kaminski and desperately cleared.

The pendulum swung towards Brentford on the 25-minute mark, Bryan Mbeumo slipping in Wissa who scooped a dipping shot over Kaminski from distance. It made little difference to the rhythm of the first half, the hosts roaring back and almost forcing an equaliser after a low cross from Issa Kaboré caused chaos in the area.

The two sides went at each other like wild-eyed boxers, throwing long hooks, swarming furiously, neither able to impose control. Lewis-Potter let another good chance slip, lashing over from the edge of the area, but Luton continued to maraud around the visitors’ final third even if a killer ball eluded them.

Just before half-time, however, Brentford tilted the match even more heavily in their favour. Having rattled the crossbar with an ambitious effort moments earlier, Mbeumo funnelled a cross into the area from the right. Reece Burke squandered two attempts to clear and Wissa poked in from five yards.

Luton threw themselves back into battle defiantly after the break, but their resolve soon crumbled. Pinnock made it three with a towering header from a corner on 62 minutes, before Lewis-Potter finally got on the scoresheet with a stooping nod after another superb ball from Mbeumo.

It has not happened often this season but, after an initial burst of frustration, a resigned hush fell over the ground. Kristoffer Ajer, back from injury, almost made it 5-0 with another headed effort, but Kaminski managed to claw it away.

When the fifth did come, it was met with little more than a shake of the head by most of the home fans. Luton’s defence went to pieces, Vitaly Janelt ghosting in behind before teeing up Schade, on as a substitute, to thunder a shot into the back of the net unchallenged.

“As good as Brentford were, I thought we were equally as bad,” Edwards said. “For the first time really this season, we looked like we showed a lack of belief in that second half … that’s something that we have to make sure we snap out of very quickly.”

The home fans were at least given something to cheer when, in injury time, a loose pass from Janelt allowed Luke Berry to steal in behind and nab a consolation.

For Brentford, it was an excellent win that confirms that, despite their mid-season slump, they fully deserve to remain in the Premier League for another year. Thomas Frank commended his side for staying “super focused”, saying it was “very pleasing” to get back-to-back victories for the first time since November.

For Luton, it was a disheartening result that provides perfect clarity. If they are relegated, they will go down knowing they have survived far worse as a club and should be in a strong position to bounce back. If they are to preserve their top-flight status, they will most likely need to finish the season with maximum points.",they still have the final stretch in front of them but it feels like luton are

Getting under way this weekend, champions Adelaide Thunderbirds open with a home clash against the Queensland Firebirds on 13 April as they look to become the first team since the Sunshine Coast Lightning in 2017-2018 to win back-to-back titles.

They will have to do it without star England goaler Eleanor Cardwell, who joined the competition’s newest outfit, the Melbourne Mavericks, alongside former Thunderbirds assistant coach Tracey Neville.

However, three-time premiership player Romelda Aiken-George and Laura Scherian, who was part of the Lightning championships, are very handy replacements for the Thunderbirds.

“We’ve got some new girls coming in, we’ve got a new flavour of netball as well as sticking to what worked well for us last year,” captain Hannah Petty said.

While the Melbourne Vixens (Lily Graham, Emily Andrew) and Giants (Erin O’Brien) have called up fresh talent to their squads, the NSW Swifts have been able to remain fairly stable and made a statement by winning the Team Girls Cup in March.

The major change for last year’s losing grand finalists is the return of shooter Sam Wallace-Joseph after two years on the sidelines with an ACL injury.

West Coast Fever were forced to recruit heavily, with only four players from their third-ranked 2023 side remaining. But close results in the pre-season competition showed they will still be a threat.

Giants co-captain Jamie-Lee Price said last year’s three-month contractual standoff with Netball Australia meant uncertainty for all.

“We had a really disruptive pre-season, which then led into, I guess, a really disrupted in-season,” Price said, flagging her team’s bumpy start during the Team Girls Cup.

The Mavericks have got off to a shaky start to Super Netball life, coming out of the pre-season tournament without a win.

They have promoted training partners Shimona Jok and Rolene Streutker, with the pair expected to make a mark after a sickening leg injury to Sasha Glasgow and an ACL problem that has sidelined defender Lauren Moore for the entire 2024 season.

The Firebirds are also on the hunt after coming seventh in 2023, just ahead of the now defunct Collingwood Magpies.

The Firebirds captain, Kim Ravaillion, said her side is primed to go, with the Queenslander returning to full duties after back surgery late last year – meaning she had to sit out most of the pre-season.

“Seeing the girls get out there has only inspired me to work super-hard in my rehab … I’ve got to round one and that was my aim,” she said.

One fresh feature for 2024 is the addition of an 11th player to match-day squads as a substitute option, specifically designated as one of the team’s training partners who has played fewer than five league matches or is under 26.

It is hoped the rule tweak will offer more players a chance to debut at the elite level.",rising out of the chaos of last year s battle over a new pay deal the flurry of lineup changes and the addition of a new team means this super netball season promises to be more unpredictable than ever getting under way this weekend champions adelaide thunderbirds open with a home clash against the queensland firebirds on april as they look to become the first team since the sunshine coast lightning in to win back to back titles they will have to do it without star england goaler eleanor cardwell who joined the competition s newest outfit the melbourne mavericks alongside former thunderbirds assistant coach tracey neville however three time premiership player romelda aiken george and laura scherian who was part of the lightning championships are very handy replacements for the thunderbirds we ve got some new girls coming in we ve got a new flavour of netball as well as sticking to what worked well for us last year captain hannah petty said while the melbourne vixens lily graham emily andrew and giants erin o brien have called up fresh talent to their squads the nsw swifts have been able to remain fairly stable and made a statement by winning the team girls cup in march the major change for last year s losing grand finalists is the return of shooter sam wallace joseph after two years on the sidelines with an acl injury west coast fever were forced to recruit heavily with only four players from their third ranked side remaining but close results in the pre season competition showed they will still be a threat giants co captain jamie lee price said last year s three month contractual standoff with netball australia meant uncertainty for all view image in fullscreen the thunderbirds will start their title defence against the firebirds on april photograph james ross aap we had a really disruptive pre season which then led into i guess a really disrupted in season price said flagging her team s bumpy start during the team girls cup the mavericks have got off to a shaky start to super netball life coming out of the pre season tournament without a win skip past newsletter promotion sign up to australia sport free newsletter get a daily roundup of the latest sports news features and comment from our australian sports desk enter your email address sign up privacy notice newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties for more information see our newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties for more information see our privacy policy we use google recaptcha to protect our website and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply after newsletter promotion they have promoted training partners shimona jok and rolene streutker with the pair expected to make a mark after a sickening leg injury to sasha glasgow and an acl problem that has sidelined defender lauren moore for the entire season the firebirds are also on the hunt after coming seventh in just ahead of the now defunct collingwood magpies the firebirds captain kim ravaillion said her side is primed to go with the queenslander returning to full duties after back surgery late last year meaning she had to sit out most of the pre season seeing the girls get out there has only inspired me to work super hard in my rehab i ve got to round one and that was my aim she said one fresh feature for is the addition of an th player to match day squads as a substitute option specifically designated as one of the team s training partners who has played fewer than five league matches or is under it is hoped the rule tweak will offer more players a chance to debut at the elite level ,The Guardian,Sports
62,"When Curb Your Enthusiasm emerged in 2000, the cult sitcom’s irascible star and creator, Larry David, wasn’t exactly a bastion of style. But over the critically acclaimed HBO comedy’s 12-season run, which draws to a close in the coming weeks, David has evolved into an unexpected fashion role model.

“Larry David is one of the bestdressed men on television,” New York magazine declared in 2020. On TikTok, videos from the likes of stylist Allison Bornstein examine the looks of an “accidental style icon”, celebrating the “classic, layered and practical” elements. Fashion publications have implored readers to channel his “laid-back dad style”. He has appeared on the front row at New York fashion week – admittedly with his fingers in his ears due to the loud music – and on the front of T-shirts, with one reading: “You’re allowed to be happy, but not in front of me.”

David has come a long way from The Pants Tent of the first episode, which centred on the awkward way his beige slacks bunched up around the groin when he sat down.

The David look entails plain, high-quality white Cotton Citizen T-shirts, well-fitting blazers, cashmere sweatshirts in muted colours, his favoured Ecco shoes and signature Oliver Peoples round glasses. On the golf course, David adds a windbreaker and a baseball cap bearing the logo of former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter’s newsletter, or the word “Menemsha”, the name of a village on Martha’s Vineyard. None of it screams stylishness or a great interest in current trends, more just a man who knows what he likes and is comfortable wearing it.

The author and cultural commentator Jason Diamond calls David’s look “post-normcore”. “It’s normal, but it’s sneaky. He dresses really well, but there’s nothing flashy about it … He’s actually one of the smartest dressers on TV.”

He likens David’s style to the “smart casual” look often found in Nora Ephron or Steve Martin films in the late 1980s and early 90s. “It’s very subtle and so people don’t really pick up on it.” Jerry Seinfeld once described the look as “Upper West Side communist”.

As with everything, David is exacting about clothes. In real life he is the son of a garment-district salesman, and approaches getting dressed with a rulebook. As he told GQ in 2020: “One should wear only one ‘nice’ piece of clothing at a time. Otherwise it’s too much. Too dressed. You have to be half dressed. That’s my fashion theory, since you asked: Half Is More.” This is the kind of pithy rule that translates well on TikTok.

But clothes to one side, “a big part of it”, Diamond says, “is he’s so confident … those shots of him just sort of gangling, walking down the street”. In our era of quiet luxury, it makes sense that such understated nonchalance would be finding fans.

Leslie Schilling, who came on board as Curb Your Enthusiasm’s costume designer when the show returned from its six-year hiatus in 2017, agrees that people “like the way that he carries himself”. But she still has people asking her: “What are those pants?’ Where do I get those?” David is 77 now, but, she says, he “doesn’t dress like a frumpy older man, he still looks very stylish”. It helps that he is “tall and slender, so fortunately things just kind of hang really nicely on him”.

Throughout Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry stays essentially the same, undimmed in his belief that he is right about the world – and the world must bend to his whims or happen around him. And this has occurred with fashion, too: the trends have come towards him. “In early seasons, Larry’s style is definitely not as put together,” says Schilling. “It’s just a little baggier, less fitted.” Her work was to gently tweak the look. “The clothes were dated and it wasn’t like he had really gone shopping a lot in that time,” she says of the hiatus years. So she chose things that were a little less baggy but not too straight, getting rid of some V-neck sweaters, adding cashmere, AG’s Tellis trousers, the occasional high-end blazer and a little more colour.

It can be hard to separate aspects of TV Larry from the real one, visually at least. “At the end of each season, he does take the clothes home,” says Schilling. She’ll see David doing an interview on TV and recognise the clothes she brought to set. There are some of David’s own clothes in the mix – especially when it comes to his golf caps – but into this, she adds new elements.

“This season, I mentioned this Paul Smith jacket, a cashmere blazer, unstructured,” she says. “At first he didn’t seem to really like it at all. And then by the end of the season, that’s all he wanted to wear.”

Ultimately, though, it’s not particularly about fashion. “He mostly wants to be comfortable and feel like himself,” says Schilling. “As long as he doesn’t have to think about it or mess with the collar, you know, he’s pretty happy.” Schilling thinks this is part of the appeal of his style: it is “approachable. People can dress like this easily without going high-end.”

This somehow effortless appeal is something Diamond and many others gravitate towards. “Across the world, people really love Larry David,” says Diamond. He predicts that in 20 or so years there will be another wave of Larry-inspired Curb-core. “I think more people should look to him as an inspiration; style and also just sort of how to live, because he’s done a good job of living.”",when curb your enthusiasm emerged in the cult sitcom s irascible star and creator larry david wasn t exactly a bastion of style but over the critically acclaimed hbo

63,"Ten years to the day after his first show for Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesquière celebrated a remarkable anniversary in the same Paris landmark where he made his debut. In the ruthless spit-em-out churn of fashion, and in the eye of that storm as the designer of the biggest brand of all, Ghesquière’s is quite the run.

A vast futuristic greenhouse lit from within with 13 vast globe-shaped chandeliers – Louis Vuitton, travel, get it? – filled an entire quadrangle of the Louvre, rising almost to the mansard roof of the museum.

The 4,000 guests – a capacity doubled for the season by the inclusion of 2,000 Louis Vuitton employees – were each greeted with a typewritten note in which Ghesquière recalled the “immense joy” he had felt 10 years ago. A few guests with deep wardrobes wore archive pieces from that first collection, which were much sighed over on the front row. On the last day of Paris fashion week, nostalgia was in the air.

But then the show started and the mood changed. This was no testimonial match; it felt more like a title challenge.

At Louis Vuitton, and before that at Balenciaga, Ghesquière has created his own distinctive fashion language that fuses opulence with futurism, which sounds unlikely to work but somehow always does, and which looks as on-point now as it did a decade ago.

Metallic-embroidered jackets with frock coat cutaways cut a clean silhouette worn with flat brogues, tab-collar biker jackets balanced bubble skirts. The pencil grey tailoring was charming, the paillette dresses sparkled, furry paw mittens lobbed in a dollop of the unexpected.

There were handbags styled like miniature vintage trunks, scratched and dented. This was Ghesquière reminding Paris fashion that although he has never had a label in his own name, his is one of the names that have shaped modern dress.

Also striking was what didn’t happen. There were no gimmicks. No pop star parachuted on to the catwalk. There were no food trucks or rollerskating waitresses. Just a fashion show for Brigitte Macron, Emma Stone, Cate Blanchett and 3,997 others.

There is a purity to Ghesquière, still a creative director who designs clothes, rather than a creative director slash entertainment mogul. All the drama is in the cut of a jacket. However, a few newfangled ideas wouldn’t go amiss: frustratingly, a decade of body diversity has yet to hit the Louis Vuitton catwalk.

Last year Louis Vuitton became the first brand to surpass €20bn(£17bn) in sales.

Louis Vuitton, like Prada, is a fashion house that began as a luggage maker. But unlike Prada, Louis Vuitton has kept the fancy luggage as a key part of its identity, and this has proved a wise move.

Fashion purists sniffed that a suitcase brand could never be taken seriously as a name in Paris fashion, but as fashion, lifestyle and entertainment have merged into one powerhouse platform, being associated with glamorous travel has helped fuel Louis Vuitton’s success.

On the prestige resale site Vestiaire Collective, Louis Vuitton is the most successful accessory brand, selling 10% faster than other bags. The appointment of Pharrell Williams last year as creative director of menswear confirmed that if Paris is the Hollywood of fashion, Louis Vuitton is the biggest superhero franchise in town.",ten years to the day after his first show for louis vuitton nicolas ghesquière celebrated a remarkable anniversary in the same paris landmark where he made his debut in the ruthless spit em out churn of fashion and in the eye of that storm as the designer of the biggest brand of all ghesquière s is quite the run a vast futuristic greenhouse lit from within with vast globe shaped chandeliers louis vuitton travel get it filled an entire quadrangle of the louvre rising almost to the mansard roof of the museum the guests a capacity doubled for the season by the inclusion of louis vuitton employees were each greeted with a typewritten note in which ghesquière recalled the immense joy he had felt years ago a few guests with deep wardrobes wore archive pieces from that first collection which were much sighed over on the front row on the last day of paris fashion week nostalgia was in the air view image in fullscreen the louis vuitton show at the louvre in paris photograph stéphanie lecocq reuters but then the show started and the mood changed this was no testimonial match it felt more like a title challenge at louis vuitton and before that at balenciaga ghesquière has created his own distinctive fashion language that fuses opulence with futurism which sounds unlikely to work but somehow always does and which looks as on point now as it did a decade ago metallic embroidered jackets with frock coat cutaways cut a clean silhouette worn with flat brogues tab collar biker jackets balanced bubble skirts the pencil grey tailoring was charming the paillette dresses sparkled furry paw mittens lobbed in a dollop of the unexpected there were handbags styled like miniature vintage trunks scratched and dented this was ghesquière reminding paris fashion that although he has never had a label in his own name his is one of the names that have shaped modern dress also striking was what didn t happen there were no gimmicks no pop star parachuted on to the catwalk there were no food trucks or rollerskating waitresses just a fashion show for brigitte macron emma stone cate blanchett and others view image in fullscreen designer nicolas ghesquière acknowledges the applause of the audience during the louis vuitton show photograph marc piasecki wireimage there is a purity to ghesquière still a creative director who designs clothes rather than a creative director slash entertainment mogul all the drama is in the cut of a jacket however a few newfangled ideas wouldn t go amiss frustratingly a decade of body diversity has yet to hit the louis vuitton catwalk last year louis vuitton became the first brand to surpass bn bn in sales louis vuitton like prada is a fashion house that began as a luggage maker but unlike prada louis vuitton has kept the fancy luggage as a key part of its identity and this has proved a wise move fashion purists sniffed that a suitcase brand could never be taken seriously as a name in paris fashion but as fashion lifestyle and entertainment have merged into one powerhouse platform being associated with glamorous travel has helped fuel louis vuitton s success on the prestige resale site vestiaire collective louis vuitton is the most successful accessory brand selling faster than other bags the appointment of pharrell williams last year as creative director of menswear confirmed that if paris is the hollywood of fashion louis vuitton is the biggest superhero franchise in town ,The Guardian,Fashion
64,"The European Commission has proposed opening negotiations with the UK to allow mobility enjoyed before Brexit to millions of young people in a major concession.

Under the envisaged agreement, EU and UK citizens aged between 18 and 30 would be able to stay for up to four years in the destination country, the European Commission said in a statement.

If agreed, a youth mobility scheme visa would be issued in those countries that participate, with possible conditions including a requirement for health insurance and proof of sufficient subsistence funds, a feature of other mobility schemes around the world.

65,"I’m on the easiest bit of one of the easiest legs of the GR20 – the self-styled hardest trek in Europe – so naturally here I am alone, lost in a cloud, with hands so cold I am seriously considering peeing on them.

In the guidebook, this was billed as a shortish, flattish day, a mere 10.2 miles (16.5km) with 670 metres of ascent. I had it circled as one to enjoy. Perhaps if it were warm, I would have a dip in Lac de Ninu, douse the fires in my calves. But when hail came, adding spikes to a slapping wind, and thunder began beating a drum behind the blank grey horizon, I thought: “Better put more layers on than take off.” I struggle with the zips, but just about find enough digital strength without resorting to anything unsanitary.

The mist on the high plain of Bocca a Reta is total, snuffing any flickers, muffling any sound, shrinking the world to an alien dome. A black salamander shivers in a divot. Bells clang softly from the necks of unknown beasts. I stop, just as shadows muster at the edge of my visible limit, and soon a man floats into range. He hurriedly relays directions, scratching a map in a sandy hollow. Finding the next refuge, Manganu, seems to depend on being able to see the lake. A bedraggled teenager trundles towards us and meets us with a wince. I wish them bon courage and march on.

Soon the mist lifts enough for me to spot a flag of Corsica, suggesting somehow I have made shelter, despite seeing not a drop of a lake. I poke my head inside the shack to see an old man with a cloth cap covering half his face, and a beard covering the rest. He is sipping a morning pastis and staring into a fire that fills the damp air with woodsmoke. I stamp my feet and shake off some rain, but still he doesn’t turn around. This doesn’t feel right. I look into my guidebook and realise this is not Manganu, but just over a mile north at the Vaccaghja Bergerie. This is, in fact, the stone living room of a shepherd called Noel. He’s seen too much for strays to faze him. Every summer, since that beard was adolescent stubble, he’s been practising transhumance, bringing goats up to graze the mountain grass.

It’s less a walk, more a 10 to 15-day challenge of body mobility, where one must crawl, clamber, slide and slither over rocks of all types

When finally I reach Manganu, I open the door to the refuge and feel the warmth of the gas stove. Wet things are dripping and steaming from every hook. All around me are those I have been walking with for the last few days, clutching mugs or slicing saucisson. Miriam and Valentin catch my eye and shuffle along a bench to make room. I had met them on the first night, up on the eyrie of Ortu di u Piobbiu refuge. While I was busy watching the sun slide away from the valley, the fierce wind was busy lifting my tent from its mooring. I noticed, just as the canvas began cartwheeling down the hill, and in a mad dash grabbed it before it neared a precipice. When I returned to my camp spot, Miriam and Valentin were waiting. They had seen the pantomime and, taking pity, taught me how to pitch when pegs don’t get much purchase by using rocks to slip into the loops where the pegs would normally go. Here they are again, offering a smile, a coffee, a biscuit. We look at the shaking windows and can’t help but laugh: this was supposed to be the easy day.

The GR20 is long – a nearly 125-mile wiggle down the spine of Corsica between Calenzana and Conca – but it’s the height that hurts: 12,700 metres up and down mountains that do not provide welcome. It’s less a walk, more a 10 to 15-day challenge of body mobility. During the first half in particular, one must crawl, clamber, slide and slither over rocks of all types: half-melted bowls, huge flat boulders, rods and ingots of grey and pink. Tiny holds are sole protection from endless falls. Everyone calls it the hardest trek in Europe; they have a point.

So, why bother? Beauty is part of it, of course, at least when the weather behaves. These are places accessible only by foot and hand, with all the spectacle and savagery that implies. Jagged peaks cut soft yellow skies. Waterfalls leap from cliffs. Cols tumble into cauldrons of stone so deep and steep-sided they could hide bandits for decades. However, these are known treasures, equalled or bettered elsewhere. So, again, why?

Everyone is dirty and hobbling as they gather for the final descent. When we catch each other’s eye, we smile. It’s been hard, and we’re tired, but the difficulty was the point

On the morning of the final day I figure it out. I look up from the rocky plateau of Paliri Refuge to the morning star, hanging above the pines in a virgin sky. The sea, not seen since day two, sleeps under a grey quilt. Soon the sun peeks over the horizon and paints colour across the clouds: purple, peach, a turquoise that belongs in dreams. I take my phone out for a photo, but the scanner doesn’t recognise my worn thumbs. I look to my scarred knee, shivering in the cold, and my grimy fingernails, and then to those all around. Everyone is dirty and hobbling as they gather tents for the final descent. When we catch each other’s eye, we smile. It’s been hard, and we’re tired, but, it’s clear now, the difficulty was the point – because now we know we can do hard things.

That even when waking up in a hill station with freezing wind whipping the tent, back aching from a night on rock, tendons stiff from yesterday, stomach in pieces from a sketchy stew, with rain coming to slick the rocks, and scree subtracting a fifth from every step – that eight hours walking up and down a mountain is possible. That every day’s challenges are soluble. All those mornings when the task seemed too much, we packed up, put our feet on the floor, completed one step, then another, and somehow made the summit. It made the difficulties of normal life seem manageable.

The essence of story is journey and return. A protagonist enters the woods and, in overcoming a trial, gains some wisdom to bring home. Stories are told to excite and entertain, but also to explore sides of human nature that normal life rarely reveals. Hard holidays work the same way. One leaves home, with its trinkets that comfort and coddle and, in devoting every energy to a challenge, none is left to ponder regrets, or sustain petty grievances. In their place, vital truths surface. That one can utter the phrase, “Oh, thank God, they have toilet paper,” and absolutely mean it. That the most banal bromide can hold the most beautiful truth. That happiness is not about new stuff, better clothes, a bigger house; nature and connection are worth far more. That we’re strong and we can do impossible things. Like walking up mountains. Or just being happy. And we pack all that knowledge in our bags and take it down the mountain.",i m on the easiest bit of one of the easiest legs of the gr the self styled hardest trek in europe so naturally here i am

66,"It’s a relief to lay my rucksack down, plunge hot feet into the cool stream and pause to revel in the fairytale surrounds. Foxgloves stand tall against a cornflower-blue sky, ferns look almost luminous, the water glints in the early summer sunshine. A patch of moss-covered ancient forest provides shade, a cuckoo calls in the distance, mountains layer on the horizon.

I’m in Knoydart in the Highlands of western Scotland, one of the last great wildernesses in the UK, on a hiking and wild camping adventure. No roads cross the 22,000-hectare (55,000-acres) peninsula, a rugged place where a trio of Munros soar skyward, sandwiched between sea lochs Nevis and Hourn (poetically translated as heaven and hell). Over five days our group of eight will explore this land on foot, carrying our sustenance and shelter on our backs, led by two guides from The Living Project, Josh and Emily.

We give people the chance to challenge themselves, but focus on the journey and moving slowly through the landscape

The rest of the world feels very far away as we linger over lunch before continuing to Barrisdale Bay farther north. Today’s hike is about eight miles over undulating terrain. An old drover’s way leads up past a loch where Highland cattle drink and we climb a 450-metre pass before descending to the coast once more. We take our time, stopping often, sometimes chatting, sometimes walking in silence. The going gets tough at points, packs feel heavy, but a sense of freedom, a revelling in the remoteness, trumps any fatigue.

Set up in 2019 by Josh Bulpin and Cormac Davey (former colleagues at World Challenge Expeditions), the Living Project offers “mindful adventures in wild places,” with trips ranging from women-only weekends in Snowdonia to weeks in Nepal. The emphasis is on connecting to nature, not epic feats of endurance, with yoga, meditation and journal writing woven into our days.

“We combine adventure and wellbeing, giving people the chance to challenge themselves, but focus very much on the journey and moving slowly through the landscape,” says Josh. “It’s not about racing up summits.”

Our trip began two days earlier in Fort William, where we’re encouraged to ditch any excess luggage. Most equipment, from tents to cooking utensils, as well as food (fresh and dried) is provided. While you don’t need experience, with packs weighing upwards of 15kg and several hours walking a day on the itinerary, a decent level of fitness is advised. Our group consists of four guys celebrating a 40th birthday, and three women and a man, ranging from mid-30s to early 60s, travelling solo. For many of us, it’s a first multi-day hike.

Wild camping is permitted in Scotland and you could, of course, do this independently. But having everything taken care of, and knowing you’re in safe hands, makes it easy to focus on the simple challenges of hiking and the wonder of the wild surrounds.

To reach Knoydart we take a train to Mallaig from Fort William – crosssing Harry Potter-famed Glenfinnan viaduct – then a ferry across to Inverie, the only settlement on the peninsula, home to around 120 people. After pitching tents on the shore at Long Beach, where mirror-flat water reflects the pinks and blues of the sky, we walk to the Lookout seafood restaurant for dinner.

We’re delighted to discover waterfalls and plunge pools and spend a magical couple of hours dipping into crystal waters

The next day dawns clear and bright for the hike to Barrisdale. After gentle yoga on the beach, Emily shares the first daily question to ponder as we walk (“Why am I here?”), and we set off into the wilderness. Soon we pass a hilltop monument to the notorious former landowner and Nazi sympathiser Lord Brocket; today much of Knoydart is community-owned after a buyout in 1999.

Our camp for the night is next to the bothy at Barrisdale Bay. We wash in the river and prepare dinner alfresco, chopping fresh veg and halloumi as the setting sun washes everything gold.

Our trip coincides with a heatwave in Scotland – and routes are always adapted to suit the weather and group needs. So, given soaring temperatures, we spend the next day exploring locally, pack-free, instead of moving on. Maps are pored over and soon Josh and Emily have a plan – a path neither of them have walked before.

We wind our way up the hillside, rising to open views over Loch Hourn. Further on we’re delighted to discover a series of waterfalls and plunge pools and spend a magical couple of hours clambering over rocks and dipping into crystal waters – a welcome respite from the heat. A thunderstorm soaks us on the hike home, its sudden power adding to the wildness of the day. That evening we cook in the bothy kitchen – an escape from the rain and the midges which plague us at sunset and sunrise (it’s June and the weather has made it a bumper midge year).

The next morning we pack up early and head off, slowly climbing again into the hills. The landscape is staggering – and there’s no one else around. A small creature stares at me from the valley below as I stop to rest – a pine marten perhaps? Buzzards ride air thermals in the sky above. Thoughts fall away as I focus on the feeling of the sun on my face and the utter peace of the mountains.

Our final wild camp is by a loch and we paddle out through mud and reeds for a swim in silky waters. I pitch my tent a little way from the others on the sandy shore. Looking out across the water, I could be the only person around.

It’s with mixed emotions that we arrive back in Inverie after a short hike the next morning. There’s time for quiet contemplation on the beach before the boat back to Mallaig and the need to re-engage with the rest of the world. We’re a little dirty, midge-bitten and sunburnt, but relaxed and happy as we head back to civilisation and a hotel with hot showers and clean sheets.

A final slap-up supper together is lively and fun. But beneath the chatter and laughter, the stillness and expansive sense of the wild remains. I think back to Emily’s first question: “Why was I there?” To escape from the world for a bit, to slow down, to leap into the unknown, immersed in nature. Knoydart has provided all that and more – a rekindling of wonder and deep feeling of peace; something I want to cling on to for a long time.

The trip was provided by The Living Project. The next Wild Pilgrim trip to Knoydart (for women only) runs from 2-7 June 2024; or on 8-13 September 2024 (for all) and costs £975, including all food while camping, two restaurant meals, one night in a hotel, most equipment, ferry crossings and trains to and from Fort William.

67,"I’m lying on my back. Directly above me is “a vault of heaven” with great wooden beams. I’ve never woken before under such a high ceiling – but then I’ve never gone to sleep in a church before.

We have arranged pew cushions on the stone slabs for increased comfort and, while this may sound austere, my fellow pilgrims and I agree we have slept remarkably well – helped by pies and cider from the Bridge Inn nearby. Just as in Chaucer’s time, there’s no point doing a pilgrimage if you can’t eat heartily and swap stories with your fellow travellers, accompanied at the inn by local musicians having an impromptu ceilidh.

St Michael’s Church in Michaelchurch Escley, in rural Herefordshire, is one of the churches that has signed up to the new and innovative night sanctuary scheme arranged by the British Pilgrimage Trust. Pilgrims can sleep there for a nominal £15 each – as rural accommodation can be costly or scarce. The Trust also arranges guided pilgrimages where luggage is transported for you by a “sherpa van” from church to church. All you need do, happily, is carry a day pack. They will even supply a pilgrim’s staff, hand-whittled from fallen wood and with a satisfying heft.

Our pilgrimage guide, Simon Lockett, assembles us in the churchyard where we lean on our staffs – inevitably someone makes a joke about a staff meeting – and talks us through the day’s journey, then leads us in a short prayer from the First Nations of North America about respect for animals.

While this is ostensibly a Christian pilgrimage, in that we travel from church to church and are guided by a vicar, the Pilgrimage Trust is always clear that this is for those who “bring their own beliefs” and is nondenominational. The pilgrimage route visits many pagan sites with spiritual resonance, such as old water sources and Arthur’s Stone. The emphasis is on those making their own personal journeys who might want peace and quiet at times to do so. Guides suggest some stretches of the walk are done in silence.

But that is generally later in the day when everyone has had time to do a bit of chattering. We set off along a wonderful green holloway carved by generations of travelling livestock, down into the Golden Valley – surely the best branding in the country – with its fields of high maize and deep broadleaved forests, where startlingly bright rowan berries are out in profusion.

Just as in Chaucer’s time, there’s no point doing a pilgrimage if you can’t eat heartily and swap stories with your fellow travellers

The group is a mixed one: some from Norfolk, some from the south-east, one from Sweden – which replicates medieval pilgrimages, when people would often travel from overseas. Aneka is amused by the British penchant for stiles, uncommon in her native country.

Having crossed a fair few, we reach an unusual tree formation, where an oak and ash have fused to grow up out of the same trunk and a hawthorn has come to join the party. Michael, a builder from Kent, decides the triumvirate has to be climbed and heads up it in sandals, to the group’s general admiration.

One pleasing thing about the pilgrimage is that it’s all about the journey and not the destination. Nobody is concerned about how fast we get anywhere, as happens on more competitive guided walks. With swallows flying around our heads, we stop for a late breakfast at Chapel House Farm, welcome after three or four miles. Proceedings are extended when, in addition to scrambled eggs, sausages, beans, roast garlic and Mexican salad, we discover their supply of chilled Herefordshire perry – which has to be sampled now, because if carried in our packs it will warm up too much. This is the sort of logic that always make sense at the time.

It’s a happy party of pilgrims who crest the hill above Craswall for our first view of the great bulk of the Black Mountains as a ridge to the west, so out of scale compared with what we’ve seen before that it’s like coming up from underwater to find an aircraft carrier looming in front of you.

These mountains form the great natural barrier between Wales and England. We don’t need the motte and bailey castles we come across to remind us that this was the scene of almost constant medieval warfare. Some swallows are determinedly mobbing a sparrowhawk that has had the temerity to fly down among them.

I’ve walked the Offa’s Dyke Path along the top of those Black Mountains and looked down on England from Wales – and speculated on how tempting those green fields of Herefordshire must have been for Welsh raiders determined to test the resolve of the marcher lords guarding them; but this is the first time I’ve seen the view looking back up.

After a delightful walk that heads south alongside the mountains, we reach the church at Clodock, which is defiantly flying a union jack in case any Welsh are peering down. The pub next door, the Cornewall Arms, is so small it’s essentially a living room with a hatch to the kitchen. One beer only is kept on draught and a few shaven-headed farmers take on the passing pilgrims at a game of quoits.

In St Clydawg church there is still a list on the vestry wall from the local assizes of 1805 detailing the tithes that must be paid: two-and-a-half pence for each milking cow, but only two pence for any cow that is barren; four pence for any colt; and two pence for every day’s supply of hay stored. Parishioners memorialised in the graveyard, such as the wonderfully named Theophilus Cope, must have forked out considerable dues.

A stream with a pool and a weir runs past the pub and provides a perfect way to wake up the next morning, with a swim under overhanging trees. Then it’s into more of the deep forest to find the charismatic “lost” Llancillo Church which, while no longer in service, is not entirely abandoned – a fine organisation called The Friends of Friendless Churches maintain its upkeep. The large Celtic cross has a plinth big enough to accommodate our group of nine as we eat packed lunches.

This is a created pilgrimage walk rather than an ancient one and very much the initiative of our guide, Simon. Simon has been a local vicar for the past 18 years and has also been a farmworker, countryside ranger and environmental activist. He wanted a way for locals and visitors to experience Herefordshire’s deep spiritual past, prehistoric and Christian. The full walk takes seven days – shorter options are available – and begins and ends at Hereford Cathedral, so loops round the Golden and Wye Valleys in a wide circle of about 60 miles. Detailed instructions on the trust website mean you can either self-guide and still stay in the churches, or sign up for occasional group walks such as ours.

With the liberation of being away from home, people say things to strangers they might not share with family or friends

While the British Pilgrimage Trust has promoted the revival of some ancient routes – such as the Old Way from Southampton to Canterbury in honour of Thomas Becket, later suppressed by Henry VIII because he didn’t want to honour a troublesome priest – it also wants to create new ones, and in doing this it is reviving the vibrancy of the call of the pilgrimage. It’s a sign of spiritual health that new routes should be created.

Perhaps now more than ever pilgrimage has an allure – it’s why the famous Camino to Santiago de Compostela in Spain has grown from fewer than 10,000 pilgrims 30 years ago to more than 200,000 today. For those who want a chance to reflect on their own lives or perhaps on the life of someone close to them who has recently died – or for anyone who wants to tap into the deep waters of the English past, such as the well of Saint Clodock we visit – a pilgrimage may answer a need.

I found the communal aspect appealing. There is a different and interesting dynamic in a pilgrimage group: less a feeling you’re a paying customer – although you are – who expects everything to be delivered and more a sense that you’re giving yourself as you go. That you are contributing to a group and sharing experiences, some of which can be revealed slowly over the course of the journey as you come to know each other. The range of subjects I learn about is enormous, from how to make blue cheese to the difference between a native and a turkey oak. And, as must have happened with pilgrims in the past, with the liberation of being away from home, people say things to strangers they might not share with family or friends. We are, in any case, all sleeping together every night – albeit each time in a different church.

Guided walks by the British Pilgrimage Trust in 2024 run from 8 May to 12 May (four days at £450), 10 June to 16 June (7 days at £740) and 18 September-22 September (four days at £450).

68,"Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, still has an influence on the cryptocurrency nearly 14 years after disappearing.

This week the protocol designed by Nakamoto – an individual or group of individuals who went silent in December 2010 – will trigger what is known as a “bitcoin halving”, a process that has coincided with price increases in the past. The latest halving is expected to take place on Saturday.

Here we explain what the bitcoin halving entails and its potential impact.

What is bitcoin halving?

It is related to how bitcoins are recorded and created. Transactions in the cryptocurrency are recorded on a universally accessible ledger called a blockchain. These transactions are put on the blockchain by “miners” who pack them into blocks that are then linked – or “chained” – together. They do this by solving a cryptographic puzzle using specialised hardware and – this is the key bit – receive a reward in newly created bitcoins.

Nakamoto intended the number of bitcoins entering circulation to be finite, at 21m, so the protocol seeks to control the amount of new coins entering the market. It does this by halving the size of the miners’ reward every 210,000 blocks – roughly every four years.

The latest halving is expected to take place in the early hours of Saturday in the US and UK, when the reward for adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain will decrease from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. Bitcoin – of which there are more than 19m in circulation – will continue to halve until the 21m point is reached, expected in 2140.

What will the impact be on the bitcoin price?

Halving reduces the supply of new bitcoins, which should in theory increase the price. It is an economic axiom that if demand for an asset remains stable while its supply decreases, its price should go up.

The past three halvings – in 2020, 2016 and 2012 – have resulted in an average price increase of 16% over the 60 days that followed, according to data from the asset research firm 10x Research. The 2016 halving resulted in a decrease of 6% over the following 60 days, although it then rallied strongly throughout 2017.

Markus Thielen, the head of research at 10x, says the halving is “associated with price increases due to reduced supply” but investors will have to wait for a price peak, which typically comes 500 days after a halving.

In recent weeks bitcoin has fallen sharply from a recent record high of more than $70,000 (£56,175) to about $62,000 but it remains a strongly performing asset, up 40% so far in 2024 and more than double where it was at the same time last year.

It is worth noting that while prices ultimately rose after the 2016 and 2020 halvings, they underwent prolonged dips – so-called “crypto winters” in 2018 and 2022 where prices underwent a prolonged dip.

“The setup feels really familiar to past occasions where there has been a very sharp rally and it forms a top … then breaks,” says Neil Wilson, the chief analyst at the brokerage firm Finalto. Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote on Thursday that the halving was “already partially priced in by the market” and that they did “not expect prices to increase significantly following the halving event”.

Will there be a negative impact?

Bitcoin mining companies, which take on the energy and equipment costs of validating transactions, face a financial hit as their reward drops.

Andrew O’Neill, the managing director of the digital assets research lab at the credit ratings firm S&P Global, wrote this week: “The block reward remains a significant part of miners’ revenue, therefore halving the reward impacts profitability.”

He added: “Some operations will become non-profitable and will shut down as result, particularly those with higher energy costs.”

To make bitcoin mining financially sustainable, S&P says, the currency will need to be used more widely throughout the global economy in order to increase miners’ revenues via transaction fees. However, greater use of the cryptocurrency jars with concerns that energy-intensive bitcoin mining is already environmentally unsustainable.

There is also, for bitcoin’s many critics, the negative impact of amateur investors being lured in by any price rise – and hype – that follows the halving.

Bitcoin has gained in legitimacy this year, increasing its price, with US Securities and Exchange Commission permitting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – that track the price of the cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, the chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, was begrudging in giving the go-ahead, describing bitcoin as a volatile asset used for “illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing”.

O’Neill is also sceptical that there will be a price boom. “The BTC [bitcoin] market is in a very different place to when the prior halvings occurred four, eight and 12 years ago,” he says. “Other drivers such as the growth of BTC ETFs in the US, and macro drivers such as interest rates and market liquidity, will also influence price.”

Carol Alexander, a professor of finance at the University of Sussex business school, says any price boost from the halving will ultimately be illusory.

“It will probably go above the all-time high but in the long run its value will be zero because there is no intrinsic value in bitcoin whatsoever,” she says. “It’s simply a speculative asset.”",satoshi nakamoto the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin still has an influence on the cryptocurrency nearly years after disappearing this week the protocol designed by nakamoto an individual or

69,"University students have turned to cyber fraud to boost their income, police have said, as they revealed they have infiltrated a huge phishing site on the dark web responsible for scamming tens of thousands of people.

The site called LabHost was active since 2021 and was a cyber fraud superstore, allowing users to produce realistic-looking websites from household names such as the big banks, ensnaring victims around the world including 70,000 in the UK.

Victims entered their sensitive details, some of which were used to steal money, but those behind the site also made money by selling details on the dark web for fraudsters to use.

The Metropolitan police said that the main victims were aged 25 to 44 years, who conduct most of their lives online.

Police believe they arrested one of the site’s main alleged masterminds this week among 37 suspects detained across the UK and overseas. The Met said arrests were made at Manchester and Luton airports, and in Essex and London.

Policing in the UK is under pressure to show it is successfully tackling the explosion in cyberfraud.

The infiltration of the site is a relative drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the problem, but police hope to shatter the confidence of criminals who believe they can act with impunity, and plan to take down more cyberfraud sites.

Fraud and cybercrime are seen as difficult to solve within policing amid battles for resources against other crime priorities such as protecting children and boosting what is widely seen as inadequate protection of women.

For now, the Met is celebrating its success. In the UK, 25,000 victims have been contacted and arrests of the site’s main users have taken place. However, some of those who used it will not be detained as their real identity remains unknown to investigators.

LabHost amassed 480,000 debit or credit card numbers, 64,000 pin numbers and made £1m from membership fees alone from 2,000 people, which were up to £300 a month for membership, to be paid in cryptocurrency. It advertised itself as a “one-stop-shop for phishing”.

It offered a tutorial video on how to use the site to commit crime, similar to a video on how to use a new consumer product. The video said the software took five minutes to install, and offered “customer service” if there were any problems. It ended by wishing its criminal users to: “Stay safe and good spamming.”

DI Oliver Richter said five years ago a cyber fraudster would need technical skills, like being able to code. Now users are in their late-teens to late-20s.

He said: “A lot of these users, they are younger, they’re at university, they are very likely to go on to perhaps perfectly legitimate careers.

“They see this, because it is so easy to do, as something that is anonymous.

“They are entering into this, I think, not fully understanding the risks and potential outcomes.”

After the site was disrupted, 800 users received a message telling them that police “know who they are and what they’ve been doing”.

Police did not reveal how they gained entry to the inner workings of the site, which occurred in June 2022.

Det Supt Helen Rance, head of the Met’s cybercrime unit, said taking down the “incredibly slick” LabHost was part of a Met effort to target those who “industrialised” crimes like fraud and 17 forces across the world were involved, as well as the private sector.

She said: “We’ve managed to infiltrate this service so we could see those responsible for it and the scale of the operation.”",university students have turned to cyber fraud to boost their income police have said as they revealed they have infiltrated a huge phishing site on the dark web responsible for scamming tens of thousands of people the site called labhost was active since and was a cyber fraud superstore allowing users to produce realistic looking websites from household names such as the big banks ensnaring victims around the world including in the uk victims entered their sensitive details some of which were used to steal money but those behind the site also made money by selling details on the dark web for fraudsters to use the metropolitan police said that the main victims were aged to years who conduct most of their lives online police believe they arrested one of the site s main alleged masterminds this week among suspects detained across the uk and overseas the met said arrests were made at manchester and luton airports and in essex and london policing in the uk is under pressure to show it is successfully tackling the explosion in cyberfraud the infiltration of the site is a relative drop in the ocean compared to the scale of the problem but police hope to shatter the confidence of criminals who believe they can act with impunity and plan to take down more cyberfraud sites fraud and cybercrime are seen as difficult to solve within policing amid battles for resources against other crime priorities such as protecting children and boosting what is widely seen as inadequate protection of women for now the met is celebrating its success in the uk victims have been contacted and arrests of the site s main users have taken place however some of those who used it will not be detained as their real identity remains unknown to investigators labhost amassed debit or credit card numbers pin numbers and made m from membership fees alone from people which were up to a month for membership to be paid in cryptocurrency it advertised itself as a one stop shop for phishing it offered a tutorial video on how to use the site to commit crime similar to a video on how to use a new consumer product the video said the software took five minutes to install and offered customer service if there were any problems it ended by wishing its criminal users to stay safe and good spamming di oliver richter said five years ago a cyber fraudster would need technical skills like being able to code now users are in their late teens to late s he said a lot of these users they are younger they re at university they are very likely to go on to perhaps perfectly legitimate careers they see this because it is so easy to do as something that is anonymous they are entering into this i think not fully understanding the risks and potential outcomes after the site was disrupted users received a message telling them that police know who they are and what they ve been doing police did not reveal how they gained entry to the inner workings of the site which occurred in june det supt helen rance head of the met s cybercrime unit said taking down the incredibly slick labhost was part of a met effort to target those who industrialised crimes like fraud and forces across the world were involved as well as the private sector she said we ve managed to infiltrate this service so we could see those responsible for it and the scale of the operation ,The Guardian,Technology
70,"Governments around the world have increasingly turned to facial-recognition systems in recent years to target suspected criminals and crack down on dissent. The recent boom in artificial intelligence has accelerated the technology’s capabilities and proliferation, much to the concern of human rights groups and privacy advocates who see it as a tool with immense potential for harm.

Few countries have experimented with the technology as extensively as Israel, which the New York Times recently reported has developed new facial-recognition systems and expanded its surveillance of Palestinians since the start of the Gaza war. Israeli authorities deploy the system at checkpoints in Gaza, scanning the faces of Palestinians passing through and detaining anyone with suspected ties to Hamas. The technology has also falsely tagged civilians as militants, one Israeli officer told the Times. The country’s use of facial recognition is one of the new ways that artificial intelligence is being deployed in conflict, with rights groups warning this marks an escalation in Israel’s already pervasive targeting of Palestinians via technology.

In an Amnesty International report on Israel’s use of facial recognition last year, the rights group documented security forces’ extensive gathering of Palestinian biometric data without their consent. Israeli authorities have used facial recognition to build a huge database of Palestinians that is then used to restrict freedom of movement and carry out mass surveillance, according to the report.



The Israeli ministry of defense did not return a request for comment on the findings of Amnesty’s report or the New York Times article on its facial-recognition programs.

The Guardian spoke with Matt Mahmoudi, an adviser on AI and human rights at Amnesty and lead researcher on the report, about how Israel deploys facial-recognition systems and how their use has expanded during the war in Gaza.

One thing that stands out from your report is that there’s not just one system of facial recognition but several different apps and tools. What are the ways that Israeli authorities collect facial data?

There’s a slew of facial-recognition tools that the state of Israel has experimented with in the occupied Palestinian territories for the better part of the last decade. We’re looking at tools by the names of Red Wolf, Blue Wolf and Wolf Pack. These are systems that have been tested in the West Bank, and in particular in Hebron. All of these systems are effectively facial-recognition tools.

In Hebron, for a long time, there was a reliance on something known as the Wolf Pack system – a database of information pertaining to just Palestinians. They would effectively hold a detained person in front of the CCTV camera, and then the operations room would pull information from the Wolf Pack system. That’s an old system that requires this link-up between the operations room and the soldier on the ground, and it’s since been upgraded.

One of the first upgrades that we saw was the Blue Wolf system, which was first reported on by Elizabeth Dwoskin in the Washington Post back in 2021. That system is effectively an attempt at collecting as many faces of Palestinians as possible, in a way that’s akin to a game. The idea is that the system would eventually learn the faces of Palestinians, and soldiers would only have to whip out the Blue Wolf app, hold it in front of someone’s face, and it would pull all the information that existed on them.

You mentioned that there’s a gamification of that system. How do incentives work for soldiers to collect as much biometric data as possible?

There’s a leaderboard on the Blue Wolf app, which effectively tracks the military units that are using the tool and capturing the faces of Palestinians. It gives you a weekly score based on the most amount of pictures taken. Military units that captured the most faces of Palestinians on a weekly basis would be provided rewards such as paid time away.

So you’re constantly put into the terrain of no longer treating Palestinians as individual human beings with human dignity. You’re operating by a gamified logic, in which you will do everything in your power to map as many Palestinian faces as possible.

And you said there are other systems as well?

The latest we’ve seen happen in Hebron has been the additional introduction of the Red Wolf system, which is deployed at checkpoints and interfaces with the other systems. The way that it works is that individuals passing through checkpoints are held within the turnstile, cameras scan their faces and a picture is put up on the screen. The soldier operating it will be given a light indicator – green, yellow, red. If it’s red, the Palestinian individual is not able to cross.

The system is based only on images of Palestinians, and I can’t stress enough that these checkpoints are intended for Palestinian residents only. That they have to use these checkpoints in the first place in order to be able to access very basic rights, and are now subject to these arbitrary restrictions by way of an algorithm, is deeply problematic.

What’s been particularly chilling about the system has been hearing the stories about individuals who haven’t been able to even come back into their own communities as a result of not being recognized by the algorithm. Also hearing soldiers speaking about the fact that now they were doubting whether they should let a person that they know very well pass through a checkpoint, because the computer was telling them not to. They were finding that increasingly they had a tendency of thinking of Palestinians as numbers that had either green, yellow or red lights associated with them on a computer screen.

These facial-recognition systems operate in a very opaque way and it’s often hard to know why they are making certain judgments. I was wondering how that affects the way Israeli authorities who are using them make decisions.

All the research that we have on human-computer interaction to date suggests that people are more likely to defer agency to an algorithmic indicator in especially pressing circumstances. What we’ve seen in testimonies that we reviewed has been that soldiers time and time again defer to the system rather than to their own judgment. That simply comes down to a fear of being wrong about particular individuals. What if their judgment is not correct, irrespective of the fact that they might know the person in front of them? What if the computer knows more than they do?

Even if you know that these systems are incredibly inaccurate, the fact that your livelihood might depend on following a strict algorithmic prescription means that you’re more likely to follow it. It has tremendously problematic outcomes and means that there is a void in terms of accountability.

What has the Israeli government or military said publicly about the use of these technologies?

The only public acknowledgment that the Israeli ministry of defense has made – as far as the Red Wolf, Blue Wolf and Wolf Pack systems – is simply saying that they of course have to take measures to guarantee security. They say some of these measures include innovative tech solutions, but they’re not at liberty to discuss the particularities. That’s kind of the messaging that comes again and again whenever they’re hit with a report that specifically takes to task their systems for human rights violations.

What’s also interesting is the way in which tech companies, together with various parts of the ministry of defense, have boasted about their technological prowess when it comes to AI systems. I don’t think it’s a secret that Israeli authorities rely on a heavy dose of PR that touts their military capabilities in AI as being quite sophisticated, while also not being super detailed about exactly how these systems function.

There’s been past statements from the Israeli government, I’m thinking specifically of a statement on the use of autonomous weapons, that argue these are sophisticated tools that could actually be good for human rights. That they could remove the potential for harm or accidents. What is your take on that argument?

If anything, we have seen time and time again how semi-autonomous weapons systems end up dehumanizing people and leading to deaths that are later on described as “regrettable”. They don’t have meaningful control and they effectively turn people into numbers crunched by an algorithm, as opposed to a moral, ethical and legal judgment that has been made by an individual. It has this sort of consequence of saying: “Well, look, identifying what counts as a military target is not up to us. It’s up to the algorithm.”

Since your report came out, the New York Times reported that similar facial-recognition tech has been developed and deployed to surveil Palestinians in Gaza. What have you been seeing in terms of the expansion of this technology?

We know that facial-recognition systems were being used for visitors coming in and out of Gaza, but following the New York Times reporting it’s the first time that we’ve heard it being used in the way that it has been – particularly against Palestinians in Gaza who are fleeing from the north to the south. What I’ve been able to observe is largely based on open-source intelligence, but what we see is footage that shows what look like cameras mounted on tripods that are situated outside of makeshift checkpoints. People move slowly from north to south through these checkpoints, and then people are pulled out of the crowd and detained on the basis of what we suspect is a facial-recognition tool.

We have seen time and time again how semi-autonomous weapons systems end up dehumanizing people

The issue there is that people are already being moved around chaotically from A to B under the auspices of being brought to further safety, only to be slowed down and asked to effectively be biometrically checked before they’re allowed to do so. We also hear about individuals that have been detained and beaten and questioned after having been biometrically identified, but later have it been established that was a mistake.

The Israeli government’s justifications for its use of checkpoints and detentions is that it’s based on national security fears. When it comes to facial recognition, how does that argument hold up from a human rights perspective?

Your rights aren’t less viable or active just because there’s a national security threat. There is, however, a three-part test that you deploy when it comes to figuring out in what particularly unique kinds of circumstances a state would violate certain rights in order to uphold others. That three-part test tries to assess the necessity, proportionality and legitimacy of a particular intervention.

At Amnesty, under international human rights law, we don’t believe that there is necessity, proportionality or legitimacy. This facial-recognition technology isn’t compatible with the right to privacy, the right to non-discrimination, the right to peaceful assembly or freedom of movement. All these rights are severely compromised under a system that is, by design, effectively a system of mass surveillance and therefore unlawful.

You’ve talked about the lack of accountability and accuracy with these tools. If the Israeli government knows these are not accurate, then why continue to use them?

I think AI-washing is a significant part of how governments posture that they’re doing something about a problem that they want to seem like they’re being proactive on. It’s been clear since the 2010s that governments around the globe have relied on tech solutions. Now, since the explosion of generative AI in particular, there’s this idea that AI is going to solve some of the most complex social, economic and political issues.

I think all it does is absolve states of the responsibilities that they have to their citizens – the obligations that they have under international law to uphold the rights of those whom they subject to their power by basically saying “the system will take care of it” or “the system was at fault”. It creates these neat grounds for states to be able to seem like they’re doing something, without being held to account on whatever they’re actually doing. There’s a technical system that is mediating both accountability and responsibility.",governments around the world have increasingly turned to facial recognition systems in recent years to target

described as regrettable they don t have meaningful control and they effectively turn people into numbers crunched by an algorithm as opposed to a moral ethical and legal judgment that has been made by an individual it has this sort of consequence of saying well look identifying what counts as a military target is not up to us it s up to the algorithm since your report came out the new york times reported that similar facial recognition tech has been developed and deployed to surveil palestinians in gaza what have you been seeing in terms of the expansion of this technology we know that facial recognition systems were being used for visitors coming in and out of gaza but following the new york times reporting it s the first time that we ve heard it being used in the way that it has been particularly against palestinians in gaza who are fleeing from the north to the south what i ve been able to observe is largely based on open source intelligence but what we see is footage that shows what look like cameras mounted on tripods that are situated outside of makeshift checkpoints people move slowly from north to south through these checkpoints and then people are pulled out of the crowd and detained on the basis of what we suspect is a facial recognition tool we have seen time and time again how semi autonomous weapons systems end up dehumanizing people the issue there is that people are already being moved around chaotically from a to b under the auspices of being brought to further safety only to be slowed down and asked to effectively be biometrically checked before they re allowed to do so we also hear about individuals that have been detained and beaten and questioned after having been biometrically identified but later have it been established that was a mistake the israeli government s justifications for its use of checkpoints and detentions is that it s based on national security fears when it comes to facial recognition how does that argument hold up from a human rights perspective your rights aren t less viable or active just because there s a national security threat there is however a three part test that you deploy when it comes to figuring out in what particularly unique kinds of circumstances a state would violate certain rights in order to uphold others that three part test tries to assess the necessity proportionality and legitimacy of a particular intervention at amnesty under international human rights law we don t believe that there is necessity proportionality or legitimacy this facial recognition technology isn t compatible with the right to privacy the right to non discrimination the right to peaceful assembly or freedom of movement all these rights are severely compromised under a system that is by design effectively a system of mass surveillance and therefore unlawful you ve talked about the lack of accountability and accuracy with these tools if the israeli government knows these are not accurate then why continue to use them i think ai washing is a significant part of how governments posture that they re doing something about a problem that they want to seem like they re being proactive on it s been clear since the s that governments around the globe have relied on tech solutions now since the explosion of generative ai in particular there s this idea that ai is going to solve some of the most complex social economic and political issues i think all it does is absolve states of the responsibilities that they have to their citizens the obligations that they have under international law to uphold the rights of those whom they subject to their power by basically saying the system will take care of it or the system was at fault it creates these neat grounds for states to be able to seem like they re doing something without being held to account on whatever they re actually doing there s a technical system that is mediating both accountability and responsibility ,The Guardian,Technology
71,"Tesla is recalling all 3,878 Cybertrucks it has shipped since the vehicle was released in late 2023, according to a Friday filing from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), following reports of a faulty accelerator pedal.

Cybertruck owners reported the vehicle’s accelerator pedal pad could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim, causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally, and increasing the risk of a crash, the auto safety regulator said in a notice.

While recalls are not uncommon in the auto industry, the stop-sale order is a major blow to Tesla, which began deliveries of its Cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year after a two-year delay due to production problems and battery-supply constraints.

The company’s shares fell nearly 3% before the bell on Friday, adding to its five-session losing streak during which the stock lost about 14%.

Tesla will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in June, the NHTSA said.

In the first quarter of 2024 the EV maker had three recalls affecting about 2.4m vehicles, according to a report by recall management firm BizzyCar. However, most issues related to Tesla recalls are usually resolved through over-the-air software updates.

In February, Tesla recalled about 2.2m vehicles in the United States due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and US safety regulators upgraded their investigation into the company’s vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis.",tesla is recalling all cybertrucks it has shipped since the vehicle was released in late according to a friday filing from the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa following reports of a faulty accelerator pedal cybertruck owners reported the vehicle s accelerator pedal pad could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim causing the vehicle to accelerate unintentionally and increasing the risk of a crash the auto safety regulator said in a notice while recalls are not uncommon in the auto industry the stop sale order is a major blow to tesla which began deliveries of its cybertruck electric pickup truck late last year after a two year delay due to production problems and battery supply constraints the company s shares fell nearly before the bell on friday adding to its five session losing streak during which the stock lost about tesla will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly at no charge and owners will be notified through letters mailed to them in june the nhtsa said in the first quarter of the ev maker had three recalls affecting about m vehicles according to a report by recall management firm bizzycar however most issues related to tesla recalls are usually resolved through over the air software updates in february tesla recalled about m vehicles in the united states due to an incorrect font size on warning lights and us safety regulators upgraded their investigation into the company s vehicles over power steering loss to the status of an engineering analysis ,The Guardian,Technology
72,"Black women are up to six times more likely to experience some of the most serious birth complications during hospital delivery across England than their white counterparts, with the figures being described as “stark” and disheartening”, according to analysis.

Black women made up 26% of women who experienced the birth complication pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension during delivery, despite making up just 5% of all deliveries across England, according to a Guardian analysis of NHS figures for 2022-23.

They were six times more likely to experience this pregnancy complication than their white counterparts, who made up 47.2% of these cases despite making up 70% of all deliveries.

Pre-eclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine, affecting between 1% and 5% of pregnant women across the UK. The condition can lead to serious complications for the mother and baby. Superimposed pre-eclampsia is when preeclampsia complicates another existing condition such as high blood pressure.

Black women were 1.5 times more likely to develop preeclampsia more generally than their white counterparts, and were also overrepresented in birth complications regarding high blood pressure, making up 16% of these cases.

Worldwide, pre-eclampsia affects up to 6% of all pregnancies and causes approximately 500,000 foetal deaths and 70,000 maternal deaths each year.

Experts said that in order to address the disparities in birth complications, the existing health inequalities such as why some ethnicities have higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure would need to be addressed.

Black women in the UK are almost four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts, while black babies are twice as likely to be stillborn.

Prof Asma Khalil, the vice president for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said structural racism and the unconscious bias of healthcare professionals could be a factor contributing to the disparity.

“The figures are striking and demonstrate inequality, but unfortunately I’m not really surprised,” Khalil said. “We know that women from a black background have a higher risk of pre-eclampsia and hypertension.

“Why this is the case is multifactorial, and I strongly believe that in order to find the solution, you need that also multidisciplinary approach. Healthcare professionals and doctors cannot fix the problem on their own, we need to work with public health doctors, policymakers, and the government need to prioritise and invest on the issue.”

Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the Labour MP and chair of black maternal health all party parliamentary group, said: “These stark figures highlight the continuing inequalities facing Black women at every stage of the birthing journey.

“With Black mothers 3.7 times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth, the government must urgently set a binding target to end this maternal mortality disparity and improve health outcomes for Black women across maternity care.”

Dr Anita Banerjee, an obstetric physician with expertise in high risk pregnancies, said the figures were “disheartening”, and that healthcare professionals building trust with marginalised communities was essential for reducing health inequalities.

Banerjee said: “We say that the NHS is free at the point of contact and that everybody should get the same, by why is it that if you’re from a black background you’re risk of complications seem to be higher, particularly in regards to maternity for pre-eclampsia.”

“What we saw during the pandemic is the importance of our cultural competency and understanding of the women that we serve, and also secondly them trusting us. We can’t stop everybody getting preeclampsia but there are certain people which have a prior propensity.

“It’s hard if you’re serving a population that isn’t used to getting that much information or understanding because they don’t feel that they’ve got our trust, it can be quite hard.”

An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS is fully committed to ensuring all women receive high-quality care before, during and after their pregnancy – all local maternity and neonatal systems now have action plans in place to help ensure care is equitable for all mothers, babies and families, with staff having access to inclusive clinical training aids to support care for women and babies with Black or dark skin.

“As these figures demonstrate, further progress is needed, which is why the NHS is investing £10m this year to enable targeted action against inequalities, including providing more holistic support for women living in the 10% most deprived areas of England, who we know are more likely to experience adverse outcomes during pregnancy and birth.”",black women are up to six times more likely to

73,"While pregnant with her son in 2015, Chipiliro Kalebe-Nyamongo’s pregnancy was generally smooth – until she reached about 33 weeks. She started to develop high blood pressure, and was admitted to hospital to be monitored. It was during this period that Kalebe-Nyamongo became concerned when she didn’t feel her baby’s movements as usual.

“At first I felt the baby kick, but it wasn’t how he would kick as usual, it felt strange,” she says. “And then I started to feel no movement at all which is when I became really concerned.

“I hadn’t felt the baby move at all and it felt like I was no longer pregnant.”

This prompted concern from the medical staff and Kalebe-Nyamongo soon prepared to undergo an emergency caesarean. But at one point staff couldn’t find a heartbeat for her baby and feared the worst.

“The doctor saw the fear in my face and then went on to say that I’m sorry, but we can’t find a heartbeat,” Kalebe-Nyamongo says.

Thankfully, Kalebe-Nyamongo’s baby survived despite being born without breathing for at least three minutes. “They tried everything to revive him but then they gave up– but is was only when they gave up that he started crying,” she says.

Kalebe-Nyamongo understood that the situation was grave, but it was only when reading her medical notes after being discharged that she came to realise she had developed pre-eclampsia, a condition that was at the time life-threatening for her unborn baby as it had caused her placenta to detach early.

“Nobody ever told me that I had pre-eclampsia, it was through reading my own medical notes that I was able to understand what had happened,” she says. “I was only told that it was an emergency situation.

“It put things into perspective for me; I was horrified that I could have lost my child if I hadn’t happened to be in the hospital at the right time.”

Pre-eclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine, affecting between 1% and 5% of pregnant women across the UK. The condition can lead to serious complications for the mother and baby.

Despite having been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure, the possibility of an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia was not made clear by hospital staff. “Of course, I would be happy to do my own research into pregnancy complications and what I might be at risk of,” she says.

“But the fact that I had high blood pressure and not one healthcare worker told me that this might lead to pre-eclampsia is worrying. I wasn’t told that it was a possibility or that there should have been any warning signs I should have been looking out for.”

Kalebe-Nyamongo, who works as a research and policymaker for Healthwatch Birmingham, said that while researching the experiences of black women during pregnancy, a shared experience was of women not being told they were at risk of pre-eclampsia, or even being properly informed that they had the condition when showing its symptoms and receiving treatment for it.

“I spoke to many women who didn’t have much knowledge about pre-eclampsia, and that – although they might have come across the term – they weren’t truly informed about whether they might be at a high risk of developing the condition or not,” Kalebe-Nyamongo says.

“It’s important that healthcare workers are active in making sure women who might have a higher risk of pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia are informed about what to recognise or to look out for.”",while pregnant with her son in chipiliro kalebe nyamongo s pregnancy was generally smooth until she reached about weeks she started to develop high blood pressure and was admitted to hospital to be monitored it was during this period that kalebe nyamongo became concerned when she didn t feel her baby s movements as usual at first i felt the baby kick but it wasn t how he would kick as usual it felt strange she says and then i started to feel no movement at all which is when i became really concerned i hadn t felt the baby move at all and it felt like i was no longer pregnant this prompted concern from the medical staff and kalebe nyamongo soon prepared to undergo an emergency caesarean but at one point staff couldn t find a heartbeat for her baby and feared the worst the doctor saw the fear in my face and then went on to say that i m sorry but we can t find a heartbeat kalebe nyamongo says thankfully kalebe nyamongo s baby survived despite being born without breathing for at least three minutes they tried everything to revive him but then they gave up but is was only when they gave up that he started crying she says kalebe nyamongo understood that the situation was grave but it was only when reading her medical notes after being discharged that she came to realise she had developed pre eclampsia a condition that was at the time life threatening for her unborn baby as it had caused her placenta to detach early nobody ever told me that i had pre eclampsia it was through reading my own medical notes that i was able to understand what had happened she says i was only told that it was an emergency situation it put things into perspective for me i was horrified that i could have lost my child if i hadn t happened to be in the hospital at the right time pre eclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine affecting between and of pregnant women across the uk the condition can lead to serious complications for the mother and baby despite having been admitted to hospital with high blood pressure the possibility of an increased risk of developing pre eclampsia was not made clear by hospital staff of course i would be happy to do my own research into pregnancy complications and what i might be at risk of she says but the fact that i had high blood pressure and not one healthcare worker told me that this might lead to pre eclampsia is worrying i wasn t told that it was a possibility or that there should have been any warning signs i should have been looking out for kalebe nyamongo who works as a research and policymaker for healthwatch birmingham said that while researching the experiences of black women during pregnancy a shared experience was of women not being told they were at risk of pre eclampsia or even being properly informed that they had the condition when showing its symptoms and receiving treatment for it i spoke to many women who didn t have much knowledge about pre eclampsia and that although they might have come across the term they weren t truly informed about whether they might be at a high risk of developing the condition or not kalebe nyamongo says it s important that healthcare workers are active in making sure women who might have a higher risk of pregnancy complications like pre eclampsia are informed about what to recognise or to look out for ,The Guardian,Health
74,"US House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said long-awaited votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific will take place as soon as Saturday, putting the senior Republican on a collision course with members of his own party.

At stake is $95bn of US security assistance that has been in limbo for months, amid fierce objections from far-right Republicans. Johnson’s decision to push ahead with the votes also puts his own job at risk, with at least two Republicans threatening to put forward a motion to remove him, just six months after he assumed the job.

How did we get here?

Congress has been frozen for months in its efforts to approve military aid for Ukraine due to growing opposition among Republicans.

The voices of isolationist Republicans have grown louder, bolstered by former president Donald Trump who has said foreign aid should be structured as a loan, not a “giveaway”, while calling into question America’s commitment to its Nato allies who are committed to Ukraine’s defence.

Efforts to pass legislation that would secure military assistance for Ukraine hit another barrier in 2023, as some Republicans began to insist that the foreign aid bill must be tied to addressing the needs at the US-Mexico border, where arrests for illegal crossings have hit record highs.

In February, the Senate voted to block the advancement of a bill that guaranteed foreign aid, while also providing new powers to shut down the border and expedite deportations.

Later that month the Senate passed a bill that provided $95bn of wartime aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, but contained no provisions related to the US border.

Despite this legislation passing with broad, bipartisan support in the Senate, Johnson continually refused to bring the Senate bill to the floor of the House. Without the House voting to approve it, the bill remained stalled up until this week.

How do the new bills differ from those the Senate approved?

On Tuesday, Johnson unveiled his proposals, which involved holding votes on three separate funding packages for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific – as well as a fourth bill that contains other Republican foreign policy proposals.

The package totals $95.3bn in spending, which matches the total the Senate passed in February, but contains a few differences designed to win over some House conservatives.

Aid to Ukraine would total about $61bn, but more than a third of that amount would be dedicated to replenishing weapons and ammunition systems for the US military.

The $13.8bn provided to Ukraine for the purchase of weapons from the US is roughly the same as the previous Senate bill.

The main difference between the two packages is that the House bill provides more than $9bn in economic assistance to Ukraine in the form of “forgivable loans”. The Senate bill included no such provision seeking repayment.

The idea of structuring the aid as a loan is a key Trump policy proposal and is supported by a number of Republicans.

Johnson says the House bill package also includes a requirement for the Biden administration to provide a plan and a strategy to Congress for what it seeks to achieve in Ukraine. The plan would be required within 45 days of the bill being signed into law. House Republicans frequently complain that they have yet to see a strategy for ending the war.



Aid to support Israel and provide humanitarian relief to Gaza comes to more than $26bn. The money dedicated to replenishing Israel’s missile defence systems totals about $4bn in both the House and Senate bills. Some of the money allocated to Israel will also cover the cost of US military operations responding to recent attacks.

Johnson has said his package for the Indo-Pacific will include about $8bn to counter China and ensure a strong deterrence in the region. The overall amount of money is about the same as the Senate bill, with a quarter of funds used to replenish weapons and ammunition systems that had been provided to Taiwan.

Why has Johnson chosen to advance the aid packages now?

After Iran’s unprecedented weekend attack on Israel, the White House and top Democrats and Republicans in the Senate called on Johnson to approve the Senate’s aid package. On Sunday, he told Fox News that Republicans understood the “necessity of standing with Israel”.

At the same time, as US aid to Ukraine has stalled, Kyiv’s position on the battlefield has reached a perilous position. Insufficient ammunition and dwindling air defence missiles have left the country’s defences exposed.

In Washington, alarm has grown at the deteriorating situation and at a hearing on Wednesday, Pentagon leaders testified that Ukraine and Israel both desperately need weapons.

On Wednesday, Johnson told reporters: “History judges us for what we do. This is a critical time right now.” According to reports in the Washington Post, Johnson’s opposition to Ukraine aid has changed since he became speaker and began to receive intelligence briefings more frequently.

Will the aid packages pass?

Johnson is attempting to corral a divided Republican party with the slimmest of majorities in the House. With a number of Republicans avowedly committed to opposing the bills, the speaker will be reliant on support from Democrats to push the legislation through.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said he plans to gather Democrats for a meeting on Thursday morning to discuss the package.



“Our topline commitment is ironclad,” he told reporters. “We are going to make sure we stand by our democratic allies in Ukraine, in Israel, in the Indo-Pacific.”

The proposals have already received a ringing endorsement from Joe Biden, who has said he will sign the packages into law immediately, should Congress pass them. A number of Republicans have indicated they will support them as well.

In an effort to satisfy conservatives in his own party, Johnson said he will hold a separate vote on a border security package, however some Republicans have already denounced the plan as insufficient.

At least two Republican House members have threatened to try to oust Johnson if he goes ahead with the votes.

Far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, was joined by Thomas Massie of Kentucky, in calling for Johnson to resign.



“I want someone that will actually pursue a Republican agenda and knows how to walk in the room and negotiate and not get tossed around the room like some kind of party toy,” Greene said. But she added that she would not move on the motion to vacate Johnson as speaker before the vote on foreign aid.

75,"Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, says he has urged Xi Jinping to press Russia to end its “senseless” war in Ukraine and that the Chinese president has agreed to back a peace conference in Switzerland.

Scholz said after a meeting with Xi in Beijing on Tuesday that “China’s word carries weight in Russia”.

“I have therefore asked President Xi to influence Russia so that Putin finally calls off his senseless campaign, withdraw his troops and ends this terrible war,” he said on social media platform X.

Scholz said Xi had agreed to back a peace conference in Switzerland, which is due to take place in June without Russia in attendance.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responded on X that China could help deliver a “just peace” for his country by playing an “active role” in the international conference.

Xi, however, appeared to dismiss the meeting in Switzerland, saying efforts towards a peaceful resolution should be recognised by both sides and include equal participation by all parties.

Russia has dismissed any such meeting as meaningless without Moscow’s participation.

China says it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict but has been criticised for refusing to condemn Moscow’s offensive.

China and Russia have ramped up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts in recent years, with their strategic partnership only growing closer since the invasion of Ukraine.

Scholz said in Tuesday’s talks with Xi that “the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine and Russia’s arms build-up have a very significant negative impact on security in Europe”, according to a recording provided by the chancellor’s office.

“They directly affect our core interests,” he told Xi, adding they “damage the entire international order because they violate a principle of the United Nations charter”.

Scholz, whose country is Ukraine’s second-biggest military backer after the US, stressed at a news conference later that it was important to “advance the diplomatic efforts that Ukraine is also working very hard on”.

“I believe that this progress is necessary because, in addition to the military support for Ukraine from Germany and its allies, there is also a need for a dialogue between the two countries,” he said.

Chinese state media, in turn, said Xi had highlighted the importance of ties in the face of “increasing risks and challenges”.

State broadcaster CCTV said Xi laid out what state media described as “four principles to prevent the Ukraine crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace”.

Nations must focus on “the upholding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains”, Xi said, as well as “cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire”, while also aiming to “reduce the negative impact on the world economy”.

The “four principles” echoed a Beijing paper last year that called for a “political settlement” to the conflict, which western countries said could enable Russia to hold much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.

CCTV also released footage, set to an uplifting classical tune, of the two leaders going for a walk in the picturesque garden of Beijing’s Diaoyutai state guesthouse for “in-depth exchanges” during the more than three hours the two leaders spent together.

The chancellor of the world’s third-largest economy landed in China – the second-largest – on Sunday, accompanied by an extensive delegation of ministers and business executives, for his second visit since taking office.

His whistlestop tour has taken him to the south-western megacity of Chongqing, economic powerhouse Shanghai and now Beijing, but he faces a tough balancing act as he aims to shore up economic ties with Berlin’s biggest trading partner.

The German government has faced pressure to loosen its close economic ties to China, particularly since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe’s dependence on Russian energy.

However, speaking after meeting the premier, Li Qiang, Scholz stressed that “we do not want to decouple from China – we want China to continue to be economically successful”.

“For us, in Germany and Europe, it is about reducing one-sided dependencies, diversifying supply chains and reducing economic risks – a goal that China itself has been pursuing for some time,” Scholz said.

His visit comes as a slew of investigations into state aid for Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines are under way in Brussels.

Li described the talks with Scholz as open and constructive, according to a statement released by Berlin.

But he stressed that countries should not be accused of having overcapacity and he pushed back against claims that China’s vast renewable energy industry was being helped by government subsidies.

Subsidies were a common practice around the world, he said, adding that the success of the Chinese renewable sector was due to its capabilities rather than state aid.

76,"Whether fictional or fact-based, Munchausen syndrome by proxy grips the public. Media depictions in The Sixth Sense and Sharp Objects and real-life news coverage of Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s December 2023 release from jail are hard to look away from. The most well-known cases—real or dramatized—are often the starkest ones, but Munchausen by proxy comes in subtler, harder-to-detect forms too.

“The media are fascinated, but they tend to depict the most extreme cases,” says Dr. Marc D. Feldman, distinguished life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and author of Dying to Be Ill: True Stories of Medical Deception.

So how do more health care providers develop the skills to recognize this form of medical child abuse and report it to the appropriate authorities?

What Is Munchausen by proxy?

Munchausen by proxy “is a form of abuse in which a caregiver feigns, exaggerates, or induces illness in another person. Typically, the caregiver is the mother, and the victim is her child,” Feldman says.

While this deception may result in tangible benefits—like disability funds or opioid medications the caregiver then abuses—the perpetrator’s primary motivation is typically attention, says Mary Sanders, a clinical psychology professor at Stanford University School of Medicine.

You may hear this type of abuse referred to by many names. While it was once primarily called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, many experts now leave out the word “syndrome” because it implied there was a neat-and-tidy checklist for diagnosing a perpetrator. There are some commonalities among the caregivers who inflict this type of abuse, but not everyone matches the same criteria, Sanders says.

Increasingly, the phenomenon is called Munchausen by proxy (MBP) abuse to emphasize the negative effects on the victim or a type of medical child abuse, says Brenda Bursch, a professor of clinical psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences and pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

Medical child abuse doesn’t specify why a caregiver is overmedicalizing a child, Sanders explains. But if the caregiver is being intentionally deceptive about an illness in a child, they are also said to have factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA), according to changes made in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a glossary of mental health diagnoses. Whatever the behavior is called, it’s pernicious—and often hard to spot.

“In the past, making a diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy was challenging because understanding the motivations of the caregiver was part of the definition,” says child abuse pediatrician Dr. Amy Gavril, a past member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Council on Child Abuse and Neglect and an associate professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine. “The motivation of an adult is an incredibly challenging thing to figure out, and, as a pediatrician, when it’s not your patient, it makes it even harder.”

Experts believe this form of abuse is largely underreported because it’s so difficult to recognize. The official incidence is about 0.5 to 2.0 cases in every 100,000 children under the age of 16, according to a 2013 Pediatrics report, but things might be much more serious than that.

“My sense is it’s vastly underrecognized by doctors because many haven’t even heard the term Munchausen abuse or medical child abuse, or they don’t really know what it is,” Feldman says. “You can’t diagnose something you don’t understand or have never heard of.”

Deception is central to Munchausen by proxy

It makes sense that MBP abuse is hard to recognize, considering the perpetrator has set out to fool everyone. “If the parent is really trying to be deceptive, they’re going to get away with it for a while,” Sanders says.

To skate by for as long as possible, caregivers frequently change medical practices before a health care provider has time to grow suspicious, Feldman says. But even qualified experts can have difficulty spotting MBP abuse. “The foundation of it is fabrication, and it’s very difficult to identify when a caregiver is not telling you the truth because we’re trained to listen to and take very seriously what a child’s caregiver has to say,” Gavril says.

Sometimes, seemingly harmless instances of deception may be an early tipoff. “I had a mother who said her child was born premature at 4 pounds, 3 ounces. But when I get the birth records, it says 8 pounds, so that’s clear falsification,” Sanders says.

A host of red flags

MBP abuse remains confusing to health care providers, legal professionals, and the public, per a 2020 review article in Annals of Pediatrics & Child Health authored by Bursch. But this isn’t the fault of any physician or specialty; it’s a problem with the medical education and child welfare systems. “Most clinicians lack the training and guidance needed to professionally, ethically, and skillfully protect victims of MBP,” she wrote.

Even without intensive training, however, it’s possible to become more alert to the red flags, the most common of which is inconsistency. “You’re looking for this mismatch between what you’re being told is going on with the child and what you’re objectively seeing,” Gavril says. “It’s those ongoing inconsistencies rather than a particular symptom” that raise suspicions, she adds, because the caregiver might claim any number of medical issues afflict the child.

Munchausen by proxy perpetrators are often very involved in the child’s medical care. They might be active in advocacy organizations for the rare condition they say the child has, or they might try to act like they are friends with you as the child’s doctor, Sanders says.

Another telltale sign is if symptoms ease when the child is separated from the abusive caregiver. “I often hear from fathers who say, ‘My former wife is presenting the child as autistic, but when he’s with me on vacation, he’s perfectly fine,’ or ‘His dietary limitations are severe and imposed by his mother. When he’s with me, he eats whatever he wants.’ That kind of information is invaluable,” Feldman says.

A 2007 Pediatrics article from the AAP’s Council on Child Abuse and Neglect suggests clinicians ask themselves the following three questions to help determine if a child may be a victim of MBP abuse:

Are the history, signs, and symptoms of disease credible?

Is the child receiving unnecessary and harmful or potentially harmful medical care?

If so, who is instigating the evaluations and treatment?

Any suspicion is enough to report

Physicians are mandated to report suspicions of child abuse. But that doesn’t mean doctors have to be sure of what they're seeing. “You don't have to know for certain that this abuse is going on. If you have a reasonable suspicion, it’s not a choice; you are a mandated reporter,” Sanders says.

Still, it’s not uncommon, Feldman says, for him to “come across cases where 20 pediatricians were consulted in a very obvious case, and no one documented any suspicions of abuse.”

That’s a problem because “the longer it goes undiagnosed, the more likely it is that permanent or severe harm is going to occur to the child,” Gavril says.

Pediatricians and mental health care providers may be most likely to notice something out of the ordinary. But every practitioner should at least be aware of the possibility of MBP abuse because victims often toggle among many different specialists, such as gastroenterologists, pediatric neurologists, and infectious disease physicians, Gavril says. These experts likely have even less training in recognizing medical child abuse than pediatricians.

Too often, health care workers are “a little frightened of documenting their concern because they’re lawsuit-averse, and they fear it’s going to be provocative if the caregiver finds out,” Feldman says. For example, in the high-profile Munchausen case of Olivia Gant, who died at age 7 in 2017, many care providers had suspicions, but none voiced concerns because “they were afraid of the bossy, domineering mom and what she might do if they made a report to child protective services,” he says. Gant’s mother is now serving 16 years in prison.

“Most doctors say ‘I didn’t report because I couldn’t prove it.’ That’s the job of child protective services or the police. We have to recognize our professional duties to the patient, and that patient is the child,” Feldman says.

Systematic issues prohibit further advancements

Child protection services don’t currently have a specific code or label for MBP abuse, so it typically gets lumped into medical neglect, Feldman says. This makes it hard to track prevalence, Bursch says.

But if advances can be made in that coding system, it could open the door for better training and education. “If we are successful in advocating for a specific category for child/adult protective services to use to correctly label and track MBP, then mandatory training will be required to educate caseworkers about proper investigation approaches and management of suspected cases,"" Bursch says. ""This support would help clinicians who have a duty to report suspected abuse even when they do not feel certain it has occurred.""

A more universal approach to electronic medical records could help, too. “We all should advocate for electronic health records to be standardized such that we can easily look at records from other facilities,” Feldman says, making it easier to recognize patterns of deception.

As Sanders emphasizes, it's essential for doctors to trust their intuition when a situation feels off. “If something is just not making sense, look further,” she says. “And not in the sense of doing more invasive investigations, but recognizing that you may not be getting accurate information.”",whether fictional or fact based munchausen syndrome by proxy grips the public media depictions in the

77,"It’s impossible to escape the soaring popularity of Ozempic and similar drugs these days—daily headlines, celebrity “success” stories, and apparent ease in procuring prescriptions (even Costco sells them now) abound. But the cumulative effect of all of this has many experts in the eating disorder field worried about how this might affect their patients. This makes sense—even for those without eating disorders, these drugs can feel both triggering and enticing. After all, research tells us about 90% of women are dissatisfied with their bodies. This sounds like a quick fix.

Then, I started hearing reports—first anecdotal, then published—that some doctors were prescribing weight loss drugs like Ozempic to their patients with eating disorders. As in, to help treat them.

As a journalist who has extensively researched the harms of eating disorders and the barriers to recovery—and as a woman who had suffered from eating disorders on and off for much of my own life—I thought I must have misunderstood. Yes, we as a society are in the midst of Ozempic Fever—and by “fever,” I’m referring to excitement, rather than a possible side effect of the drug (which it is). Researchers are continuing to find new potential applications for these drugs, initially developed to treat type 2 diabetes. In March, the FDA approved a new indication for the weight-loss drug Wegovy (which has the same active ingredient as Ozempic), allowing it to be used as a treatment to reduce the risk for heart attack and stroke. Ozempic, a diabetes drug, used off-label for weight loss, is also being studied to treat anxiety and depression, polycystic ovary syndrome, substance abuse, Alzheimer’s, and now—eating disorders.

It’s early days and research hasn’t yet caught up with the enthusiasm. But our cultural misunderstanding of eating disorders, even by well-meaning practitioners, could exacerbate the illnesses for those who suffer from them—and have dire consequences.

The new class of weight loss drugs mimics the body’s GLP-1 hormone, stimulating insulin production, and lowering blood sugar levels, helpful to those with type 2 diabetes. The drugs also curb appetite and slow the speed that food moves into the small intestine—you feel full more quickly and eat less. Many patients without eating disorders who take these drugs, have reported a reduction of “food noise” in their minds—referring to obsessive thoughts and preoccupation with food. (Though, as philosopher Kate Manne wisely posited in a recent New York Times piece, isn’t “food noise,” simply, hunger?)

For folks suffering from binge eating disorder (BED) or bulimia nervosa (BN), a drug that decreases appetite may seem to make sense. Both illnesses are characterized by eating large amounts of food, eating until uncomfortably full, and feeling distress around that (bulimia is distinguished by purging after a binge).

Binge eating often emerges as part of a cycle of restriction—dieting, fasting, or eliminating entire food groups—like carbs, for example. “Many people struggling with BED view the binge episodes as the problem and the restriction as something to strive for,” said Alexis Conason, a psychologist specializing in the treatment of binge eating disorder. “When people with BED take a GLP-1 medication that dampens their appetite, many are excited that they can be ‘better’ at restriction and consume very little throughout the day.” Subsequently, Conason adds, there is a dangerous potential for BED to then morph into anorexia, starving oneself with possibly life-threatening complications.

Eating disorders are complex illnesses that aren’t yet fully understood, even by experts in the field. Underneath the behaviors around food is often an intricate web of trauma, anxiety, and even genetic predisposition, all set against the backdrop of a culture that prizes thinness. Low weight is frequently (incorrectly) conflated with good health, and people in larger bodies are often subjected to bullying, negative stereotypes, and discrimination in the workplace.

Emerging research strongly supports that for many, eating disorders are brain-based illnesses and in most cases, there exists a co-morbidity like anxiety, mood disorders, or substance abuse.

“GLP-1’s can’t help someone deal with their stress, anxiety, [and] trauma-history,” said psychologist Cynthia Bulik, one of the world’s leading eating disorder researchers, and Founding Director of the University of North Carolina Center of Excellence of Eating Disorders. “All of that background distress—fundamental distress that might be driving the BED in the first place—is temporarily bypassed by removing the desire to eat.”

Nearly 30 million Americans will have an eating disorder in their lifetime, but only about 6% of those are medically diagnosed as “underweight,” according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. This means that a person may exhibit all of the diagnostic hallmarks of anorexia, for example, extreme restriction and even malnourishment, but still present as average weight or even overweight. They may even be told by a physician to lose weight, despite the fact that they are already going to dangerous extremes to chase that “goal.”

“We tend to think that everyone in a larger body with an eating disorder must have BED and everyone in a smaller body must have anorexia, but this couldn’t be further from the truth,” said Conason. “So many people with BED seek help in weight loss settings instead of seeking eating disorder treatment; many view the problem as their weight and think they need more help sticking to their diet” when in reality, an end to the restriction would more likely regulate their eating.

It’s much easier to get weight loss treatment than help for an eating disorder. There is no standard of care for eating disorders in this country and treatment is unregulated. While there are some promising, evidenced-based treatments (cognitive behavioral therapy for adults, and family-based treatment for children and teens), they don’t work for everyone. If a person is fortunate to be diagnosed and receive adequate treatment, relapses are common and full recovery can be elusive.

Further, these drugs are often intended to be taken for a person’s entire life. “When they go off the drug, or can’t access it due to supply problems, the urge to binge comes right back and they have not developed any psychological (or) behavioral skills to manage the urge,” Bulik told me. Just like with a diet, any lost weight will likely be regained when a person stops taking the drugs. Weight fluctuations, themselves ,may increase a person’s risk of chronic illnesses like type 2 diabetes, according to multiple studies.

“The focus on weight and erasing the desire to eat could indeed do harm,” cautioned Bulik. “The potential for abuse is high and will become higher with new preparations that don’t require an injection … Remember, these drugs are ‘for life.’ Stop them, and everything comes rushing back.”

The long-term side effects of GLP-1’s are not yet known. But the harms of eating disorders are: eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness (second only to opioid overdose). People with eating disorders are more likely to attempt suicide, and during COVID-19, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for eating disorders at pediatric hospitals skyrocketed, particularly for young women. According to the CDC, emergency room visits for 12-17 year old girls who suffer from eating disorders doubled during the pandemic. Those numbers, as shown by recent studies, have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.

An even greater concern is that the gaps in comprehensive care for eating disorders invite experimental, potentially harmful treatments and leave patients vulnerable. GLP-1’s may seem like a short-term “fix,” but they won’t graze the deeper issues nor will they diminish the eating disorder crisis in this country. And it is a crisis—every year, eating disorders cost the U.S. more than $65 billion.

I know too well that if a doctor advises their patient with an eating disorder “here’s something to make you eat less” most patients would happily oblige. That’s part of the pathology of the illness. It’s the eating disorder talking. Ideally, it wouldn’t be your doctor’s voice, too.",it s impossible to escape the soaring popularity of ozempic and similar drugs these days daily headlines celebrity success stories and apparent ease

78,"Whooping cough is making a post-pandemic comeback in China, with cases surging more than 20-fold in the first two months of 2024.

The world’s second-most populous country reported a combined 32,380 cases of pertussis—more commonly known as whooping cough—in January and February, compared with 1,421 cases during the same period in 2023, according to the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration. There were 13 deaths.

The number of infections detected in the first 60 days of the year is near the full 2023 total, underscoring the risk of the highly contagious respiratory disease in China. The country endured a major respiratory disease outbreak in 2023 after pulling itself out of the Covid mire in late 2022, well after other nations had thrown open their borders and allowed pathogens to resume their traditional circulation patterns.

China provides free vaccines for whooping cough, usually in a combined shot that also protects infants against diphtheria and tetanus. Experts say the vaccine-induced immunity tends to wane as kids reach adolescence. Chinese health authorities don’t mandate or provide booster shots to help shore up immunity.

Discussions are needed to determine if the country should update the vaccine it uses for the disease or adjust the immunization program, Shen Hongbing, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a conference in March.

“It requires close attention to prevent and control the spread of whooping cough in China,” Shen said, according to local media reports.

Vaccination woes

Whooping cough infections have been rising in China since 2014, with more than 30,000 in 2019, according to the Chinese CDC. After a respite during the Covid isolation days, they bounced back to almost 40,000 a year in 2022 and 2023, the agency reported.

Nuances around vaccination are contributing to the increase. Covid disruptions, waning protection and genetic changes may all be playing a role.

Older patients can experience atypical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and allowing them to covertly carry and spread the infection. Meanwhile, genetic changes may help the bacteria elude an immune system primed to detect it, allowing the pathogen to continue sickening even the immunized, according to a Beijing Daily report.

Vaccination rates worldwide suffered during the pandemic. The percentage of children getting all three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis shot plunged to 81% in 2021, the lowest level since 2008, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund.

Global issue

The disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis is transmitted through respiratory droplets. It’s a significant cause of infant death worldwide and continues to be a public health concern despite high vaccination rates, according to the WHO.

China isn’t alone in its comeback. Whooping cough is endemic and epidemic cycles are occurring every two-to-five years, despite vaccination programs, according to the WHO.

Some European countries have posted rising cases since the middle of 2023, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. The Czech Republic is suffering its biggest outbreak since 1963, and both it and the Netherlands have reported whooping cough-related deaths.",whooping cough is making a post pandemic comeback in china with cases surging more than fold in the first two months of the world s second most populous country reported a combined cases of pertussis more commonly known as whooping cough in january and february compared with cases during the same period in according to the national disease control and prevention administration there were deaths the number of infections detected in the first days of the year is near the full total underscoring the risk of the highly contagious respiratory disease in china the country endured a major respiratory disease outbreak in after pulling itself out of the covid mire in late well after other nations had thrown open their borders and allowed pathogens to resume their traditional circulation patterns china provides free vaccines for whooping cough usually in a combined shot that also protects infants against diphtheria and tetanus experts say the vaccine induced immunity tends to wane as kids reach adolescence chinese health authorities don t mandate or provide booster shots to help shore up immunity discussions are needed to determine if the country should update the vaccine it uses for the disease or adjust the immunization program shen hongbing director of the chinese center for disease control and prevention said at a conference in march it requires close attention to prevent and control the spread of whooping cough in china shen said according to local media reports vaccination woes whooping cough infections have been rising in china since with more than in according to the chinese cdc after a respite during the covid isolation days they bounced back to almost a year in and the agency reported nuances around vaccination are contributing to the increase covid disruptions waning protection and genetic changes may all be playing a role older patients can experience atypical symptoms leading to misdiagnosis and allowing them to covertly carry and spread the infection meanwhile genetic changes may help the bacteria elude an immune system primed to detect it allowing the pathogen to continue sickening even the immunized according to a beijing daily report vaccination rates worldwide suffered during the pandemic the percentage of children getting all three doses of the diphtheria tetanus and pertussis shot plunged to in the lowest level since according to the world health organization and the united nations children s fund global issue the disease caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis is transmitted through respiratory droplets it s a significant cause of infant death worldwide and continues to be a public health concern despite high vaccination rates according to the who china isn t alone in its comeback whooping cough is endemic and epidemic cycles are occurring every two to five years despite vaccination programs according to the who some european countries have posted rising cases since the middle of according to the european center for disease prevention and control the czech republic is suffering its biggest outbreak since and both it and the netherlands have reported whooping cough related deaths ,TIME,Health
79,"One of the first lines of poetry on Taylor Swift’s double album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” finds the singer crooning, “I was a functioning alcoholic till nobody noticed my new aesthetic.” The lyric could very well have been penned by the featured artist and co-writer on the song, Post Malone, who has had his fair share of public struggles with alcohol. The guest spot on the moody electropop opener, “Fortnight,” is Malone’s latest high-profile gig in a growing list, perhaps because of, as Swift wrote online, “those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever.”

Malone scored his first hits doing hip-hop cosplay, but he never had much interest in rap or in being a rapper. Almost as soon as he swagger-jacked his way into the monoculture, the artist born Austin Post set off on a path closer to his heart, swerving his Bentley through a genre-agnostic pop sphere and, like any scenester worth his salt, jumping lanes and crashing into the zeitgeist.

Now, after a handful of albums full of breezy pop-rock odes to self-medication and self-loathing, Post Malone is going country.



It’s not an entirely surprising move: His albums have increasingly flirted with the timbres and tropes of country, in the spurs-on-the-snare stomp of “Go Flex,” the gently strummed orchard metaphor of “Lemon Tree” and several country-cousin pop tunes on last year’s “Austin.”

The inevitability of Malone’s country turn intensified last year, when he appeared on a remix of “Dial Drunk,” by rising stomp-clap banjo picker Noah Kahan. Like pop’s leading culture vulture, Drake, Malone jumped on the bandwagon just in time to say he was holding the reins. Soon, Malone began teasing collaborations with country megastars Luke Combs, fresh off a cover of one of the best songs ever written, and Morgan Wallen, a wannabe outlaw with a pinched twang and trouble with alcohol. Then, he made his latest case for bland ubiquity by drawling vowels on Beyoncé’s brand-friendly “Levii’s Jeans,” a head-scratching collaboration that even Nile Rodgers and The-Dream couldn’t save.

Malone is a savvy navigator, and he knows his stuff. He name-dropped country revivalists Sturgill Simpson, Tyler Childers and Colter Wall on — where else — Joe Rogan’s podcast, and, over the years, his choice in country cover songs has been pitch-perfect — Simpson’s “You Can Have the Crown,” Toby Keith’s “As Good as I Once Was,” Brad Paisley’s “I’m Gonna Miss Her” — even if he hasn’t been. When he’s strumming and singing country tunes, Malone is heavy on the vibrato but light on the gravity.



In November, Malone kicked off his country coming-out party at the Country Music Association Awards, joining Wallen and Hardy for a cover of Joe Diffie’s “Pickup Man.” Malone outshined both the bro-country star and the butt rocker, and was well received. (Unsurprisingly, he was spared the backlash that festered into Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter.”) But the real star of the show was a true rapper-gone-country, Jelly Roll, a 39-year-old who sings the country gospel from the heart and has actual rap bona fides: He was pouring out Southern rap syrup when Malone was making synth-pop parodies for high school projects.",one of the first lines of poetry on taylor swift s double album the tortured poets department finds the singer crooning i was a functioning alcoholic till nobody noticed my new aesthetic the lyric could very well have been penned by the featured artist and co writer on the song post malone who has had his fair share of public struggles with alcohol the guest spot on the moody electropop opener fortnight is malone s latest high profile gig in a growing list perhaps because of as swift wrote online those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever malone scored his first hits doing hip hop cosplay but he never had much interest in rap or in being a rapper almost as soon as he swagger jacked his way into the monoculture the artist born austin post set off on a path closer to his heart swerving his bentley through a genre agnostic pop sphere and like any scenester worth his salt jumping lanes and crashing into the zeitgeist now after a handful of albums full of breezy pop rock odes to self medication and self loathing post malone is going country it s not an entirely surprising move his albums have increasingly flirted with the timbres and tropes of country in the spurs on the snare stomp of go flex the gently strummed orchard metaphor of lemon tree and several country cousin pop tunes on last year s austin skip to end of carousel the style section style is where the washington post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means including the arts media social trends politics and yes fashion all told with personality and deep reporting for more style stories click here end of carousel the inevitability of malone s country turn intensified last year when he appeared on a remix of dial drunk by rising stomp clap banjo picker noah kahan like pop s leading culture vulture drake malone jumped on the bandwagon just in time to say he was holding the reins soon malone began teasing collaborations with country megastars luke combs fresh off a cover of one of the best songs ever written and morgan wallen a wannabe outlaw with a pinched twang and trouble with alcohol then he made his latest case for bland ubiquity by drawling vowels on beyoncé s brand friendly levii s jeans a head scratching collaboration that even nile rodgers and the dream couldn t save malone is a savvy navigator and he knows his stuff he name dropped country revivalists sturgill simpson tyler childers and colter wall on where else joe rogan s podcast and over the years his choice in country cover songs has been pitch perfect simpson s you can have the crown toby keith s as good as i once was brad paisley s i m gonna miss her even if he hasn t been when he s strumming and singing country tunes malone is heavy on the vibrato but light on the gravity in november malone kicked off his country coming out party at the country music association awards joining wallen and hardy for a cover of joe diffie s pickup man malone outshined both the bro country star and the butt rocker and was well received unsurprisingly he was spared the backlash that festered into beyoncé s cowboy carter but the real star of the show was a true rapper gone country jelly roll a year old who sings the country gospel from the heart and has actual rap bona fides he was pouring out southern rap syrup when malone was making synth pop parodies for high school projects ,The Washington Post,Entertainment
80," — The big fight that takes place toward the end of the new show “The Outsiders” ranks as one of the most impactful (literally) moments of this, or any, Broadway season. And the director, Danya Taymor, pulls it off by gathering all the theatrical tools at her disposal, except for music — a daring choice for a musical.

Those familiar with S.E. Hinton’s novel “The Outsiders” or its movie adaptation by Francis Ford Coppola — and that’s a lot of people in this country — know that the story, set in 1967 Tulsa, revolves around two warring gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. In the show, their climactic, rain-soaked rumble is punctuated only by the thumps of fists and kicks viciously hitting their targets, by grunts of rage and groans of pain. Rick Kuperman and Jeff Kuperman’s fight and movement choreography works in symbiosis with Brian MacDevitt’s stark lighting and Cody Spencer’s imaginative sound design.

Similar inventiveness is on display throughout, albeit on a smaller scale, as when a few tires and boards are enough to make us see characters jump aboard a freight train. The one major stumble is the burning of an abandoned church, a key scene that is baffling if you don’t know what’s meant to happen. (The scenic design is by the collective AMP featuring Tatiana Kahvegian.)

So yes, “The Outsiders” is compelling from a visual standpoint. It’s when the characters open their mouths that it falters.

Adapted by Adam Rapp (“The Sound Inside”) and Justin Levine (who also wrote the score with the folk-rock duo Jamestown Revival), the show’s book closely follows the novel’s framework. Center stage in both is the 14-year-old narrator, Ponyboy (an appropriately angsty Brody Grant), who has been living with his older brothers Sodapop (Jason Schmidt) and Darrel (Brent Comer) since their parents’ death.



The siblings are all Greasers, the chosen family of assorted misfits who proudly live on the wrong side of the tracks. Their enemies, the rich Socs (short for “socialites”), are blessed with “better clothes and better cars and better lives,” as Ponyboy explains in an introductory number, “Tulsa ’67,” that lays down the setting and the stakes in a clump of artless exposition.

And therein lies the problem: The show overexplains everything, all the time. Hinton knew exactly how much to say and when — the paperback edition of “The Outsiders” is just 180 concise, evocative pages that let us discover things along with Ponyboy. Here, both the book and the songs tend to underestimate the audience’s intelligence. (This is surprising coming from Rapp, who is usually not afraid of ambiguity.)

The novel’s Darrel, for example, is a distant cipher for most of the story, making Ponyboy’s realization of how much his brother loves him all the more poignant. Onstage, on the other hand, Darrel details the emotional weight he’s shouldering early on in “Runs in the Family,” one of the several “I want” numbers that dot the show — in case we don’t understand the first time, or the fifth, that underneath the bravado, these are sensitive kids, yearning for love and stability. Even “Queen of the Socs” Cherry (Emma Pittman) gets to share a bit of domestic turbulence.

The most troubled are Johnny (Sky Lakota-Lynch), a shy teen who is Ponyboy’s brother by bond, and the boys’ friend and protector Dallas (Joshua Boone). Originally an unpredictable loose cannon, Dally, as his friends call him, is now an honorable knight in black leather, whom Boone imbues with a warm voice and a steady gravitas. That character’s background and dreams have been developed in the show, perhaps in an attempt to make him, like Darrel, less opaque — as if theatergoers were assumed to lose interest when not hand-fed backstory.



But this backfires, lessening the suspense and tension in a tale in which violence is either central or humming in the background. Not that you would know it from a score overly reliant on samey folk-pop ballads that lack dramatic weight and can feel redundant. Immediately after Johnny kills a Soc (Kevin William Paul) in a strongly staged scene, for example, he and Ponyboy sing a song, “Run Run Brother,” that starts by rehashing what we have just seen, to much lesser effect. A musical where the sonic storytelling constantly pales next to the visual one has a bit of a problem on its hands.

81,"StarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars ) As much as Guy Ritchie’s uber-violent, stakes-free, World War II action comedy caper “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” milks its “based on a true story” bona fides, it’s more akin to the last decade’s glut of slick, cool-guy popcorn pictures (including his own) than any meaningful retelling of real heroism. Its contemporary ties don’t stop Ritchie (the man who brought us “Sherlock Holmes,” “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” and “The Gentlemen”) from aping famous bits from much better, more serious classic war films. Like the sequence on a fishing trawler straight out of “The Guns of Navarone” that opens this liberally fictionalized account of a covert 1942 mission. Dubbed Operation Postmaster, its goal was to take down a German supply ship full of U-boat carbon dioxide filters, which would factor into a crucial turning point in the war.

To turbocharge the bro-historic intrigue and get the astronomical body count going in this shoot-’em-up grand theft aquatic, Ritchie must first assemble a ragtag squad of lethal (and lethally photogenic) heroes so rascally you know they’ll get the bloody job done. You see, Hitler is marching across Europe, Britain’s in a bind, and Winston Churchill (Rory Kinnear, beneath a mountain of prostheses) is desperate enough to clandestinely okay a deniable, off-the-books mission. Luckily, Brigadier Gubbins (Cary Elwes), head of the secret Special Operations Executive (SOE) org, knows just the rakish rule breaker for the job.



Enter Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), leader of a team of ruthless killers willing to play dirty to disrupt Nazi business off the African coast. His squad is Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson), a Danish hulk with an exaggerated lilt and astounding archery skills; Freddy Alvarez (Henry Golding), a frogman with a talent for explosives; Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer), a master strategist; and cunning young Irish sailor Henry Hayes (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).

They’re not in it alone. Already in place on the Spanish island of Fernando Po, where the Germans have set up shop in neutral territory, are SOE agent-slash-actress Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González, who holds her own, if not always her British accent), tasked with seducing a sadistic Nazi officer (Til Schweiger), and suave undercover fixer Richard Heron (Babs Olusanmokun), whose popular casino bar serves as such an unsubtle nod to “Casablanca” that a character drops one of Humphrey Bogart’s most iconic quotes while sitting in his cafe.

Off in their own glam spycraft ’n’ subterfuge romp for half the film, they’re two of the more interesting figures in an overstuffed ensemble that includes Eton-educated West African prince Kambili Kalu (an excellent Danny Sapani), who lends his resources “because the Nazis are gauche,” and young wartime secretary Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), who must have gotten plenty of 007 inspiration from his wartime stint.



Shot on location in Turkey and Britain, the film’s handsome production design is undone by its dull photographic patina. Costume designer Loulou Bontemps’s standout achievement is a stunning replica of Claudette Colbert’s 1934 “Cleopatra” cutaway gown that Stewart wields like a weapon. Christopher Benstead’s score goes from whistling spaghetti Western motifs to jazzy percussives. Yet the plot breezes on with flimsy banter and bloodshed to go along with scant character development.

Adapted from Damien Lewis’s 2014 book “Churchill’s Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII,” the screenplay by Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, Arash Amel and Ritchie is oddly weightless given that its real-life commandos, heralded as precursors to the British Special Air Service (SAS) and modern black ops warfare, died in combat before war’s end.

If you come, come for Cavill sniping Nazis by the hundreds with manic deadpan abandon, and stay for Ritchson looking like he stepped out of a Gold’s Gym to destroy hordes of German hostiles with a bow and arrow. Then dive into the real history of the SOE, whose men and women could fill dozens more fascinating spy films without blunting the edges of history with fizzy bromantic antics.

82,"As President Biden visited his childhood home in Scranton, Pa., this past week, pro-Palestinian protesters gathered nearby chanting, “Genocide Joe has got to go!” That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, “Wake up, sleepy Joe!” and “I am your nightmare, Biden!”

At a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump. They held signs reading “Joe Biden: You’re Fired” and waved flags bearing the former president’s name. Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: “Well, you haven’t been driving in the right places, pal. … He has no presence here.”

At other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, “Four more years” or “We love you, Joe.” One group held a sign reading “Scranton Loves Joe!”



The question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States — a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between — and strategists will be paying close attention to the state’s Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.

“Look, you’re my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,” Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. “No, it’s not hyperbole. You’re the ticket to the White House.”

Polls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state — which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 — to come down to the wire in 2024.

In a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump’ policies from abortion to election denialism.



But Biden’s visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country’s direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.

“I’ve never thought I’d see a time when I’m going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that’s in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says ‘F Biden,’ and having a little kid standing with his middle finger — 7 years old, 8 years old,” Biden said. “Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It’s not who we are.”

David Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump’s successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.

“The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren’t as bad as they are,” Urban said.

This past week, Biden was pushing hard.



He unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.

And Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

As Biden’s birthplace and the largest battleground state — home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes — Pennsylvania looms large in the president’s personal and political backstory. It’s a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.



That’s a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.

Like Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats’ venerated “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.

With a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation’s political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.



At a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.

“All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,” Trump said. “That’s why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, ‘You’re fired. Get out. You’re fired.’”

Biden’s swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.

On Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president — who was in New York facing a court trial — was “busy right now.”



His speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city’s large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting “Black livelihoods,” and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).

Throughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up — she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams — and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania’s “third senator” because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.

At the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump’s margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign’s on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden’s effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.



That advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden’s 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.

“The gap is huge between what the president’s campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,” McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.

But for Trump’s allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans’ dominance in rural counties.



“This ’24 race feels way more like ’16 than ’20,” Urban said. “The antipathy toward Biden — I won’t say it’s the same as it was toward Clinton, but it’s definitely present. The chants of ‘FJB’ are louder than they’ve ever been.”

Like Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.

In Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to persuade some 40,000 voters to write in “uncommitted” rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday’s primary. Given Pennsylvania’s tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.

Biden’s team hopes the state’s voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.",as president biden visited

83,"In early February, congressional Republicans made a conspicuous choice. They decided to kill a bipartisan Senate deal that included tough border security measures. Instead, they pressed forward with what was essentially a messaging exercise: impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The confluence of events was telling. Even by the accounts of several Republicans, their party preferred attacking the Biden administration over the crisis at the border to actually doing something about it.

Two months later, Mayorkas’s impeachment is dead. The Senate dispatched with the trial quickly Wednesday afternoon shortly after finally receiving a pair of articles of impeachment against him from the House.

It was predictable that the Democratic-controlled Senate would do this. But Republicans hope it will, at the very least, make Democrats look bad — as if they aren’t interested in holding accountable a man who Republicans say is responsible for the chaotic border.



And will it make the Democrats look bad?

There is no question the border is a major liability for President Biden. Mayorkas isn’t exactly a sympathetic character, either; a recent poll showed that independents dislike him by a 2-to-1 margin.

But the GOP’s impeachment effort was troubled from the start — in ways that sharply undercut the claim that Democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial. Even many Republicans said Mayorkas’s actions weren’t impeachable, and the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways.

There was, of course, the remarkable initial vote in which the GOP-controlled House somehow failed to impeach Mayorkas. Three House Republicans voted against it, and a Democrat whom the GOP didn’t expect to be present returned to leave the GOP one vote shy. The GOP ultimately succeeded a week later, by one vote.



Fast-forward to Wednesday, and the GOP was again unable to keep its membership united. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) moved to vote on whether the articles against Mayorkas were unconstitutional — basically that they did not meet the Constitution’s standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. On the first article, Mayorkas’s alleged “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted “present.”

It appears to be the first time in modern history that a senator from the impeaching party didn’t vote with the party against dismissing charges. Republican senators were united in opposing such a motion in the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment — even as 10 later voted to acquit Clinton — and Democratic senators were also united in opposing a motion to dismiss Donald Trump’s post-Jan. 6 impeachment charges three years ago.

Similarly, it’s the first time every senator from the president’s party voted to dismiss the charges. A lone Democrat voted against dismissing Clinton’s charges in 1999, and five Republicans voted against dismissing Trump’s in 2021.



The handful of GOP defections undersell just how much concern there was about what their party was doing. Several GOP senators who voted against dismissing the charges nonetheless had previously labeled the whole thing a waste of time. They said the House hadn’t shown that Mayorkas actually did anything impeachable. They said Mayorkas was basically just carrying out the administration’s policy.

Those senators can perhaps justify their votes against dismissing the charges by saying the Senate should hold an actual trial if the House impeaches. But it’s also evident that such a trial might well have resulted in a remarkable number of defections on the impeaching party’s side — if the GOP senators stayed true to their past comments about Mayorkas.



Of course, the intricacies of Congress — and whether an alleged offense is technically impeachable or just bad — are generally of little concern to the American people. So Republicans will point to this as evidence that Democrats aren’t taking the border seriously and hope the American people care about it.

What we can say right now is that it’s not clear Americans care or can be made to care that much. That poll mentioned above, from the Economist and YouGov shortly after Mayorkas’s impeachment, showed Americans approved of it 43 percent to 25 percent — a pretty large margin. And, as mentioned, the poll also showed Mayorkas was unpopular.

But it also showed 4 in 10 Americans didn’t even have an opinion of him — reflecting how few people were tuning in to the whole thing. And we don’t have other good polling on this, in large part because it doesn’t seem to have penetrated as a story.",in early february congressional republicans made a conspicuous choice they decided to kill a bipartisan senate deal that included tough border security measures instead they pressed forward with what was essentially a messaging exercise impeaching homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas the confluence of events was telling even by the accounts of several republicans their party preferred attacking the biden administration over the crisis at the border to actually doing something about it two months later mayorkas s impeachment is dead the senate dispatched with the trial quickly wednesday afternoon shortly after finally receiving a pair of articles of impeachment against him from the house it was predictable that the democratic controlled senate would do this but republicans hope it will at the very least make democrats look bad as if they aren t interested in holding accountable a man who republicans say is responsible for the chaotic border and will it make the democrats look bad there is no question the border is a major liability for president biden mayorkas isn t exactly a sympathetic character either a recent poll showed that independents dislike him by a to margin but the gop s impeachment effort was troubled from the start in ways that sharply undercut the claim that democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial even many republicans said mayorkas s actions weren t impeachable and the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways there was of course the remarkable initial vote in which the gop controlled house somehow failed to impeach mayorkas three house republicans voted against it and a democrat whom the gop didn t expect to be present returned to leave the gop one vote shy the gop ultimately succeeded a week later by one vote fast forward to wednesday and the gop was again unable to keep its membership united senate majority leader charles e schumer d n y moved to vote on whether the articles against mayorkas were unconstitutional basically that they did not meet the constitution s standard of high crimes and misdemeanors on the first article mayorkas s alleged willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law sen lisa murkowski r alaska voted present it appears to be the first time in modern history that a senator from the impeaching party didn t vote with the party against dismissing charges republican senators were united in opposing such a motion in the bill clinton impeachment even as later voted to acquit clinton and democratic senators were also united in opposing a motion to dismiss donald trump s post jan impeachment charges three years ago similarly it s the first time every senator from the president s party voted to dismiss the charges a lone democrat voted against dismissing clinton s charges in and five republicans voted against dismissing trump s in the handful of gop defections undersell just how much concern there was about what their party was doing several gop senators who voted against dismissing the charges nonetheless had previously labeled the whole thing a waste of time they said the house hadn t shown that mayorkas actually did anything impeachable they said mayorkas was basically just carrying out the administration s policy those senators can perhaps justify their votes against dismissing the charges by saying the senate should hold an actual trial if the house impeaches but it s also evident that such a trial might well have resulted in a remarkable number of defections on the impeaching party s side if the gop senators stayed true to their past comments about mayorkas of course the intricacies of congress and whether an alleged offense is technically impeachable or just bad are generally of little concern to the american people so republicans will point to this as evidence that democrats aren t taking the border seriously and hope the american people care about it what we can say right now is that it s not clear americans care or can be made to care that much that poll mentioned above from the economist and yougov shortly after mayorkas s impeachment showed americans approved of it percent to percent a pretty large margin and as mentioned the poll also showed mayorkas was unpopular but it also showed in americans didn t even have an opinion of him reflecting how few people were tuning in to the whole thing and we don t have other good polling on this in large part because it doesn t seem to have penetrated as a story ,The Washington Post,Politics
84,"For the better part of the past eight years, Donald Trump has laid the groundwork to get voters to dismiss any adverse result in a court of law as the product of a political “witch hunt” or a “weaponized” justice system. Now the effort is reaching its culmination, with Trump suffering multiple major losses in civil court and his first criminal trial starting in Manhattan this week, 6½ months before the presidential election.

Americans writ large aren’t inclined to accept Trump’s framing at this point. But even skeptics harbor concerns about his being given a fair shake in ways that could especially matter with his Manhattan trial underway.

Let’s take it piece by piece.

1. Americans mostly blame Trump and say the scrutiny is appropriate

One consistent finding in the polls is that Americans don’t broadly buy into the “witch hunt” framing. They don’t appear to have much sympathy for Trump, because they think he has brought this situation upon himself.



A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in December asked whether the Justice Department was “holding Trump accountable under the law like anyone else” or “unfairly targeting Trump for political reasons.” Americans chose the former by a wide margin: 57 percent to 41 percent. Even 20 percent of Republicans said Trump was being treated justly.

A January USA Today-Suffolk University poll featured a similar, if somewhat less lopsided, split. A majority — 52 percent — agreed that the legal actions against Trump were the “appropriate work of the justice system,” compared with 43 percent who said they were “inappropriate and should be dropped.”

And a  poll from August showed Americans are significantly more inclined to blame Trump’s many criminal charges on his actions (47 percent) than on a supposed “political abuse of the justice system” (31 percent). (An additional 21 percent said it was hard to know.)

2. Crucially, they also think he’s guilty

Another hurdle for Trump in all of this is that, regardless of perceptions of the process, Americans by and large think he’s actually a criminal. While reviews of each individual indictment vary — around half or less think he’s guilty in a given case — clear majorities think he has committed at least some significant crimes.



In a New York Times-Siena College poll conducted last week, Americans said 54 percent to 37 percent that Trump has committed serious federal crimes. (Even about 1 in 5 Republicans agree.)

In the Post-UMD poll, Americans said 56-33 that Trump was guilty of election subversion. Twice as many said he was “definitely guilty” (40 percent) as said he was “definitely innocent” (21 percent).

And even aside from whether he’s ultimately found guilty, Americans see there being legitimate evidence that could at least point in that direction — and seemingly justify charges and a trial. In a Public Religion Research Institute poll in August, Americans said 58 percent to 37 percent that there was “credible evidence” that Trump committed “serious federal crimes.”

At the very least, most Americans haven’t thrown a blanket over these cases and dismissed them outright, as Trump would like. As many as 4 in 10 align with his argument that he’s being politically targeted, but fewer see him as essentially blameless or that there’s no justification for the charges.

3. They do see politics at work and aren’t convinced the process will be fair

All of that said, larger numbers of Americans do harbor a certain skepticism of these proceedings that could ultimately matter, depending on how things unfold. They see politics at play and aren’t convinced Trump will be treated fairly.



That could be particularly relevant given that the case they regard with the most skepticism, in Manhattan, is going first and could be the only trial held before the election.

Some Americans are of two minds on this. While the Times-Siena poll has shown that clear majorities think Trump has committed crimes, in its December edition, Americans said 49 percent to 43 percent that they didn’t believe he would get a fair and impartial trial in his federal election-subversion case.

Similarly, a Reuters-Ipsos poll this month showed Americans were slightly more inclined to believe Trump’s prosecutions were “excessive and politically motivated” (48 percent) than not (41 percent).

We see that “politically motivated” label lingering in other polls. The Times-Siena poll in December showed Americans about evenly split on whether the charges were “politically motivated” (46 percent) or based on the prosecutors’ actual belief that he committed crimes (48 percent).



And on no case has the perception been more pronounced than the Manhattan one. In a March 2023 Quinnipiac University poll, shortly before Trump was indicted, twice as many said the case was “mainly motivated by politics” (62 percent) as said it was “mainly motivated by the law” (32 percent).

Seeing politics at play is not the same as seeing Trump as blameless or not warranting charges.

But you begin to see how the Manhattan prosecution being the first and potentially only pre-election case could harm the efforts to prosecute Trump. Only about a third of Americans think Trump is guilty in the case; they see the charges as less serious; and sizable numbers are on the lookout for unfairness and politics.",for the better part of the

85," — Collin Morikawa had another solid round Friday in the RBC Heritage with a 5-under 66 and appears to be getting back to the reliable form that made him a two-time major champion. Masters champion Scottie Scheffler’s form never seems to change. Even after an emotionally taxing victory at Augusta National, a quick trip home to Dallas and only nine holes of practice, the world’s No. 1 player is right in the mix.

It’s crowded at the top after two days of warm, ideal conditions for scoring at Harbour Town, and this $20 million signature event is wide open going into the weekend.

Morikawa had a four-way share of the lead with Tom Hoge (64), J.T. Poston (68) and Sepp Straka, who recovered from an opening drive that plunked a spectator in the head and led to a double bogey. Straka saw blood but settled down after hearing the spectator was going to be fine, then put together eight birdies for a 65.



They were at 11-under 131, one shot ahead of a group that features Ludvig Aberg, the Masters runner-up who is starting to get anointed the biggest challenger to Scheffler.

Scheffler, whose Masters win was his third title in his last four starts, didn’t look as though he did anything special, the very trait that makes him so good. He was bogey-free, picked up birdies on the par 5s on the front nine and then ran off three birdies in a four-hole stretch on the back for a 65.

He was three shots back.

“Didn’t really struggle for par too often today,” Scheffler said. “I felt like I was attacking the golf course pretty well. Was able to post a good number. I felt like today when I stepped on the first tee I was ready to go.”

Morikawa has been searching for the key to that repeatable swing of his that led to a PGA Championship title in 2020 at Harding Park and the British Open a year later. He won last fall in Japan, but has been lacking the trust in whatever fix he keeps making.



But he found something at Augusta National last week — he was among those tied for the lead on Sunday until a pair of double bogeys around the turn — and kept hitting the sweet spot during practice and the opening two rounds of the RBC Heritage.

It’s not perfect, and that certainly was the case Friday. But he feels he is finally on the right path. Morikawa doesn’t feel as though he struck the ball well — he missed 10 greens — and still managed a 66.

“Still have a lot of trust in the swing,” he said. “Whether it went right or wrong, I was able to kind of accept the fact and move on. Two or three months ago — or even two weeks ago — if I saw a couple of bad shots it was like, ‘What do I fix? What do I try?’

“I kind of roughly know where the ball is going, and even when I’m missing it, still everything is a little bit tighter,” he said. “That’s all you can ask for.”



Straka was rattled at the start when he bloodied the spectator. The tee shot was out of play, and Straka checked on the fan to make sure he was OK. He didn’t miss another tee shot the rest of the way.

“You never really want to catch a driver on the fly, especially to the head,” Straka said. “That was tough.”

Aberg is emotionally drained from a week in contention, just like Scheffler. But at 24, he expects to be able to handle the fatigue. His swing is so pure and simple, it never looks as though he is trying very hard.

The Swede had a great finishing kick with four birdies over the last six holes, and one clever change of equipment. Aberg switched out his 2-iron for a 7-wood just for the par-5 15th hole, with has a 90-foot tree protecting the left side.

Share this article Share

The 2-iron was too flat. The 7-wood gives him some height, and it soared from 258 yards over the treetops to about 30 feet for a two-putt birdie.



Rory McIlroy, who knows about hitting a high ball, was impressed for the two days they spent together at Harbour Town. McIlroy was scrappy with his irons again and still managed to stay in the mix at 7-under 135, four shots back.

He was pushing for Aberg to be on the Ryder Cup team last year without having seen him play in person.

“I had way too many people telling me this guy was going to be one of the best,” McIlroy said of when Aberg turned pro last June. “His attitude is absolutely perfect to play golf. It’s not very often the person lives up to the hype. But he lived up to the hype.”

86," — Scottie Scheffler is running on fumes after an exhausting Masters victory just four days ago. He hit a shank from a bunker. He nearly lost his mind from mud on his golf ball. And he still managed a 2-under 69 at the RBC Heritage on Thursday.

J.T. Poston set the pace on an idyllic day on Hilton Head Island with nine birdies — six of them in a seven-hole stretch — for a 63 that gave him a two-shot lead over Collin Morikawa and Seamus Power.

Ludvig Aberg, the runner-up at Augusta, was in the group another shot behind. Rory McIlroy birdied his last two holes to salvage a scrappy day with the irons for a 67.

Thousands of fans lined the fairways of Harbour Town to see Scheffler, the Masters champion who is going for his fourth win in his last five tournaments. There were times Scheffler didn’t look like the No. 1 player in the world, and he figured that would be the case with very little time to prepare.



“That’s why I tried to give myself an extra little bit of grace on the course today, just because yeah, emotionally a little drained. Mentally, definitely a bit drained,” he said.

“I feel like I have more energy now than I did at the beginning of the day, waking up to go play golf,” he said. “I think getting into the tournament, hitting some shots, getting a bit frustrated, getting a bit excited about my finish there, all good emotions to feel. It’s nice to be kind of back into tournament mode.”

All but 16 players in the 69-man field were at the Masters, at least for part of the week. Poston closed with a 70 at Augusta National and arrived at Hilton Head Island with a little excitement away from golf. This is the first time traveling with his month-old daughter, Katherine Scott.

They’re calling her Scottie, a family name from both sides of the family.



“Good time to be called Scottie,” Poston said with a smile.

Poston chipped in from 65 feet on the par-3 fourth hole to begin a remarkable run — three straight birdies from the 10-foot range followed, and then a 15-foot birdie putt on the short par-4 ninth and another birdie from 10 feet to start the back nine.

For Morikawa, it was more validation he’s on the right track. The two-time major winner was among those who had a share of the lead Sunday at the Masters until he took a pair of double bogeys around the turn. He wound up in a tie for third.

“A lot of swing thoughts I’ve kind of been flipping the book through worked for one day or two days and then it’s gone,” Morikawa said. “But look, it lasted all the way through the Masters. It’s lasted through here. What I’m doing, it’s working. I’ve just got to stick to that and understand why it’s working and just go out there and play golf.”



Scheffler and Jordan Spieth were in the group behind Poston getting all the attention — Scheffler as the dominant player in golf, Spieth because his entertainment level is high. The fans probably weren’t expecting a shank, and neither was Scheffler.

It happened on the third hole. He was in a bunker right of the green and hit it off the hosel of the club at a 45-degree angle away from the pin, over the green. He chipped to 6 feet and missed the putt, making double bogey.

“I shank it a decent amount, but never in competition,” Scheffler said. “I tried to give myself a little bit of grace there. It clearly was just a mental lapse and I wasn’t quite into it yet. I had a much better back nine.”

That had its moments, too, all on one hole. The 11th gives him fits off the tee, and he finally drilled one, only to see a clump of mud on his ball. His approached headed left and kept going as Scheffler shouted, “MUD BALL!” And the frustration was evident.



He talked to himself harshly down the fairway, especially seeing the ball carom off a slope into the bunker, leaving him an impossible shot. Scheffler did well to blast out to the fringe, and then he holed the putt for par.

“I was obviously frustrated with that type of break, and then to get up there and knock the putt in was a nice feeling,” he said. “Used it as some good momentum for the closing stretch.”

He hit wedge to 4 feet for birdie on the 16th, made a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th and ended the day with another round below par. Scheffler now has 37 consecutive rounds at par or better dating to the Tour Championship last August.

Justin Thomas missed the cut at the Masters in horrific fashion by playing the final four holes in 7 over to miss by one.

87,"With seemingly fewer friends posting to their main Facebook and Instagram feeds, Meta has introduced a new feature its users can talk to: an AI chatbot. The feature, named Meta AI, is rolling out to the company’s main apps including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. It’s primarily a conversational chat window where you can ask questions and generate AI images, similar to other AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Co-Pilot and Google’s Gemini.

Despite over a year of artificial intelligence being everywhere, this could be many people’s first interaction with the technology. Meta has billions of users across its apps, and anyone who has managed to avoid the bots so far will find this one nearly impossible to escape.

Why is this AI chatbot here?

Facebook and Instagram users probably weren’t banging down Mark Zuckerberg’s door demanding an AI chatbot, so why is this feature suddenly everywhere? The technology is still new and its utility debatable. However, the major tech companies have decided that, like voice assistants and scrollable vertical videos before it, AI is the next big thing. Now they are competing to push out their versions. Facebook and Instagram used to rely on users’ friends, family and communities to keep their attention. Now, as these platforms are aging, the companies may hope a chatty bot can replace some of the human interaction.

How do I find it?

The chatbot is integrated in search and messaging features across Meta’s apps, and may appear in your feed under some posts as well. If you don’t see the AI features it yet, check back later. Its presence is marked with its logo: a thin ring that’s mostly blue and occasionally animated. The AI tool can also be accessed online on the stand-alone website meta.ai. It is not included in the company’s app for children, Messenger Kids.



On Facebook, tap the search icon on top and you’ll find that the usual search bar has been replaced with one that says, “Ask Meta AI anything.” As you start typing, it will auto-suggest searches. Anything with the blue circle next to it is going to bring up the AI chat window. You can also tap the messages icon and engage with Meta AI as if it’s another pal to talk to. If you see it under a post in your feed, it will suggest questions to ask related to the content you see.

In Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, you’ll also find Meta AI has taken over the search bars and appears as another chat. If your accounts are connected to each other, the Meta AI conversation should pick up where you left off, regardless of what app you’re in.

How do I turn it off?

There’s no way to get rid of Meta AI in search, confirmed Meta. In WhatsApp, there is an option to hide the new Meta AI button by going to Settings → Chats → Show Meta AI Button. However, it’s still in the search bar. Other apps have an option to mute its replies. I asked the AI chatbot how to turn it off and got multiple incorrect answers with instructions that did not work and for settings that don’t exist.



You can delete a chat with Meta AI to remove it from recent conversations in the same way you would any other chat. Swipe left on the chat and select Delete in Instagram, More → Delete on Facebook and Messenger, and More → Delete Chat on WhatsApp.

How do I get started?

Start typing full sentences or random words in any of the apps’ search bars or in the conversations with Meta AI. If this is your first time using an AI chatbot, you can begin by asking simple questions and even for a list of ways to use it.

I did the first things any normal person does when testing an AI tool. I asked it to be my pretend boyfriend, told it to generate images of ducks writing breakup letters and tried to push its boundaries. I discovered it avoids partaking in overtly sexual conversations or generating photos of the Pope (entirely unrelated questions). As with all artificial intelligence, there are creative ways to get around its filters.

Meta AI includes options for shortcuts. Type a forward slash and command, like /joke:, /imagine: or /story: and type your description after. However, these aren’t really necessary since you can make the same requests in a conversational way, such as “tell me a story about depressed hamster who ran for mayor.”

What should I use it for?

An AI chatbot is like having an enthusiastic but unreliable friend. You can ask it almost anything — but never assume it’s telling the truth. With that in mind, use Meta AI for fun and for noncritical tasks. Ask random questions like you would with Google, start conversations to feel less alone and use it to brainstorm.



Meta AI can also generate images, though in our tests they have the typical flaws associated with artificial intelligence. Most share the hyper-realistic lighting that AI images are known for, fumble details like fingers and eyes, and frequently give women exposed, ample cleavage.

There are plenty of other things you can try. Ask Meta AI to animate images, request a summary of the day’s news or ask it to take on the personality of a specific character when speaking to you. Because it’s integrated with Meta’s other products, you can use it to search things like “Reels of people learning to roller skate.”

To get the best results and avoid bland responses, ask follow-up questions and give as many details as possible. For a list of starter ideas, check out Tech Friend Shira Ovide’s recommendations of useful things to ask a chatbot.

What should I not use it for?

Don’t use AI as an authority for anything of consequence. For example, don’t rely on a chatbot for medical advice or as a source for school or work. Ethically, you shouldn’t use it to write papers for school, though Meta AI is happy to spit out wooden essays on demand.



Experts warn there is a danger of misinformation from tools like Meta’s chatbot. To steer clear, avoid using it as a go-to for anything sensitive or political. Turn to human sources instead like reporters, experts, even Wikipedia and Reddit, before artificial intelligence. For more advice on avoiding misinformation, check out our guide.

How is it different from other AI bots?

For the basics, Meta AI appears to spit out the same generic answers as its competitors. I asked five different chatbots about the best taqueria in San Francisco, a vegetarian meal plan, if God exists and how to know if a polycule is right for you. For the most part, they all gave incredibly similar, mundane but neutral answers with the exception of Microsoft’s Co-pilot, which does not enjoy shenanigans.

88,"When we fly, there’s a small risk that a battery powering our phones or laptops could start a dangerous fire on board. But the most common source of battery-related fires in airplane travel is surprising: vape pens. A safety organization that tracks airline battery incidents grew so concerned that it recently flagged the vaping fire trend to the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees electronic smoking devices.

On July 20, 2018 an e-cigarette battery burst into flames when going through a security checkpoint at Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport. (Video: Transportation Security Administration via Storyful)

On average in the United States, there are more than two reports each week of battery-related fires, smoke or similar incidents on planes or at airports, according to voluntary reporting by passenger and cargo airlines.

That’s tiny compared with the several hundred thousand passenger flights each week.

Air travel is very safe. But recent high-profile airplane mishaps combined with the small but growing number of battery-related fires can make it unnerving to fly.



I’ll walk you through the dangers of battery fires in flight, why vape pens are a leading cause and what we can do to keep one another safe.

Yes, e-cigarette batteries can catch fire

Vaping devices are powered by lithium-ion batteries, like those in smartphones, wireless earbuds and most other rechargeable devices.

Generally, the fire risk is lower from smaller batteries, like those in vape pens and electric toothbrushes, than from larger ones in laptops, e-bikes and electric cars. Any lithium-ion battery fire, though, can spread quickly.

Last year, about 35 percent of battery-related fire or smoke incidents reported by airlines were caused by vape pens, according to records compiled by the safety nonprofit UL Standards & Engagement.

That’s at least double the share of battery-related fires from other leading sources — portable power banks and phones.



Since more of us are schlepping phones on board than vape pens, the numbers suggest the risk is relatively higher from a vape pen.

The number of battery fire incidents is very small. And the Federal Aviation Administration, which has a separate database of battery-related problems, shows that most overheating e-cigarettes are contained without harm.

But airplanes are a unique setting. If something goes wrong with a battery-powered device on board, it can go very wrong.

How to reduce the risk of in-flight battery fires

Don’t pack e-cigarettes or other battery-powered devices in your checked luggage. Airlines tell you this, but people may not know the rules or forget that they packed a vape pen or portable battery in a suitcase that gets gate-checked.

The risk is that no one will see a fire that starts in the baggage hold before it grows out of control.



Don’t charge vape pens on board the plane. It’s not allowed. Take that rule seriously. There’s typically a higher fire risk when a battery is charging.

Last year, a Spirit Airlines flight to Orlando made an emergency landing because of a fire from a vape pen that was charging in an overhead bin.

A reminder: You’re not allowed to smoke on planes. That includes e-cigarettes.

Tell a flight attendant or other personnel immediately if you see smoke or fire. Airline crews have special training and fire containment bags for battery-powered gadgets.

The faster passengers notice that a battery-powered device is overheating, bulging or catching fire, the better the chance the risk is contained.

Keep your vape pen within arm’s reach. And treat it gently. Eric Soule, an East Carolina University professor who specializes in e-cigarettes and public health, believes travelers with vape pens might smush a bag into the overhead bin and not realize the activation button could be pressed by accident. That might cause a fire.



In flight or anywhere, Soule said, “People need to know where their e-cigarettes are at all times.”

If you keep a vape pen in your pocket and the battery overheats, get it away from your body quickly. People are burned that way.

If your vaping device has an on/off switch, turn it off before you put it in your pocket or a bag.

Also, if you crunch your phone or vape pen in your airplane seat mechanism, tell the flight crew. A damaged battery increases the potential fire risk.

What’s beyond your personal control. E-cigarettes exist in a regulatory gray area. Many devices you can buy are not authorized by the FDA and essentially illegal.

Dave Wroth with UL Standards & Engagement said the organization is worried that popular but unauthorized types of disposable vape pens may lack effective battery safety mechanisms.



The American Vapor Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group, said that if the FDA approved more vaping products, there would be fewer battery safety problems from illegal devices. (Anti-tobacco groups may not like that.)

The FDA last year proposed new manufacturing requirements for e-cigarettes, including their batteries.",when we fly there s a small risk that a battery powering our phones or laptops could start a

89,"For months, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has boasted of a plan to spread artificial intelligence across its services, allowing billions of people to use chatbots in everything from Facebook to its VR-powered goggles. That vision is becoming a reality. Zuckerberg announced Thursday that the company will integrate the latest version of its conversational chatbot, Meta AI, across its social media apps, allowing the tool to generate images and answer questions from its users.

The company also introduced the latest iteration of its large language model, Llama 3, a move that puts Meta’s AI tools squarely in competition with the leading AI chatbots, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft’s Copilot and Anthropic’s Claude. Zuckerberg touted the revamped Meta AI product as the “the most intelligent AI assistant” that is free to use.



But experts warn that the broad use of the AI chatbot may amplify problems that have long plagued Meta’s social networks, including harmful misinformation, hate speech and extremist content. The company’s image generator is also likely to spark debates about how it chooses to depict race and gender when drumming up imaginary scenarios.

“There was a general fear about how LLMs would interact with social and exacerbate misinformation, hate speech, etc.,” said Anika Collier Navaroli, a senior fellow at Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism and a former senior Twitter policy official. “And it feels like they just keep making it easier for the bad predictions to come true.”

Meta spokesman Kevin McAlister said in a statement that it is “new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.



“Since we launched, we’ve constantly released updates and improvements to our models and we’re continuing to work on making them better,” he added.

While Meta AI will be available on a new stand-alone website, it will also populate search boxes on WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Meta has also experimented with putting the AI assistant into groups on Facebook, where it automatically chimes in to answer questions in groups if no one has responded in an hour.

Meta has long faced scrutiny from activists and regulators about how it handles dicey content about politics, social issues and current events. AI-powered chatbots, which are known to “hallucinate” and give responses that are false or not grounded in reality, could deepen these controversies.

Including the chatbots is “inviting these tools to opine on topics from education to health, housing to local politics — all domains where developers of AI technology should be treading carefully,” said Miranda Bogen, the director of the AI Governance Lab at the think tank Center for Democracy and Technology and a former AI policy manager at Meta. “If developers fail to think through the contexts in which AI tools will be deployed, these tools will not only be ill-suited for their intended tasks but also risk causing confusion, disruption and harm.”



On Wednesday, Princeton computer science and public affairs professor Aleksandra Korolova posted screenshots on X of Meta AI speaking up in a Facebook group for thousands of New York City parents. Responding to a question about gifted and talented programs, Meta AI claimed to be a parent with experience in the city’s school system, and it went on to recommend a specific school.

McAlister said that the product is evolving and that some people may start to see “some responses from Meta AI are replaced with a new response that says ‘This answer wasn’t useful and was removed. We’ll continue to improve Meta AI.’”

This week, an entrepreneur experimenting with Meta AI in WhatsApp found that it made up a blog post accusing him of plagiarism — even offering a formal citation for the post, which does not exist.



Image generators such as Meta’s have also come with their own problems. Earlier this month, a Verge reporter struggled to get Meta AI to generate images of an Asian person with a white person in a couple or as friends, despite giving the service repeated and specific prompts. In February, Google blocked the ability to generate images of people on its artificial intelligence tool Gemini after some users accused it of anti-White bias.

Now, Navaroli said she worries that biases baked into AI tools “will be fed back into social timelines,” potentially reinforcing those biases in a “feedback loop to hell.”

Korolova, the Princeton professor, said Meta AI’s potentially false claims in Facebook groups are probably “only a tip of the iceberg of harms Meta didn’t anticipate.”",for months meta ceo mark

90," — Last June, Inflection AI was riding high. The artificial intelligence start-up founded by veterans of Google’s famous DeepMind AI lab had just raised $1.3 billion from Microsoft and tech billionaires Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman and Eric Schmidt to build out its chatbot business. But less than a year later, the tide has turned. Co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan have left Inflection AI for jobs at Microsoft, which also now has the rights to use its technology. Inflection AI is now focused on helping other companies improve their own AI tools.

It’s not the only case of AI hype coming back down to Earth. After 11 months of public testing, Google’s AI search tool still constantly makes mistakes and hasn’t been released to most people. New scientific papers are undermining some of the flashier claims about the tech’s capabilities. The AI industry is also facing a growing wave of regulatory and legal challenges.



A year and a half into the AI boom, there’s growing evidence that the hype machine is slowing down. Drastic warnings about AI posing an existential threat to humanity or taking everyone’s jobs have mostly disappeared, replaced by technical conversations about how to cajole chatbots into helping summarize insurance policies or handle customer service calls. Some once-promising start-ups have already cratered and the suite of flashy products launched by the biggest players in the AI race — OpenAI, Microsoft and Google — have yet to upend the way people work and communicate with each other. While money keeps pouring into AI, very few companies are turning a profit on the tech, which remains hugely expensive to build and run.

The road to widespread adoption and business success is still looking long, twisty and full of roadblocks, say tech executives, technologists and financial analysts.

“If you compare a mature market to a mature tree, we’re just at the trunk,” said Ali Golshan, founder of Gretel AI, a start-up that helps other companies create data sets for training their own AI. “We’re at the genesis stage of AI.”



The tech industry is not slowing down its charge into AI. Globally, venture-capital funding in AI companies grew 25 percent to $25.87 billion in the first three months of 2024, compared with the last three months of 2023, according to research firm PitchBook. Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon are all investing billions into AI, hiring PhDs and building new data centers. Most recently, Amazon poured $2.5 billion into Anthropic AI, bringing its total investment in the OpenAI competitor to $4 billion.

The immense cost of training AI algorithms — which requires running mind-boggling amounts of data through warehouses of expensive and energy-hungry computer chips — means that even as companies like Microsoft, OpenAI and Google slowly begin charging for AI tools, they’re still spending billions to develop and run those tools.

Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said earlier this month that companies including Deutsche Bank, the Mayo Clinic and McDonald’s were all using Google’s tools to build AI applications. And Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s most recent conference call that interest in AI helped contribute to an increase in cloud revenue. But on the same call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the company’s investment in data centers and computer chips to run AI would mean Google’s expenses would be “notably larger” this year than last year.



“We are helping our customers move from AI proof-of-concepts to large-scale rollouts,” said Oliver Parker, an executive with Google Cloud’s AI team. He pointed to Discover Financial Services as one example — the company used Google’s AI to build a tool for its call centers that reduced the amount of time it took to do each call.

Microsoft has also been trumpeting the interest in its AI tools and says 1.3 million people now use its “GitHub Copilot” AI code-writing assistant. It’s also pushing a $30-a-month AI assistant to the millions of Microsoft Office users around the world. But the company has been mum on whether any of the tools are profitable when compared with the cost of running them. Like Google, the firm has focused much of its energy on getting customers to use its cloud services to run their AI apps.

“We’re finding that AI requires a paradigm shift,” said Jared Spataro, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of AI at Work. “It’s not like a traditional technology deployment where IT flips a switch. Businesses need to identify areas where AI can make a real impact and strategically deploy AI there.”



In October, OpenAI announced its own version of the app store, where people could make their own custom versions of the popular chatbot, ChatGPT, upload them to a public marketplace, and get paid by OpenAI if many people used them. Three million custom GPTs have been created, but the company hasn’t said whether it has paid out any money yet.

“These tools are not yet pervasive, not even close,” said Radu Miclaus, an AI analyst at tech research firm Gartner. He expects that to begin changing soon. “My expectation is that this year the applications will start taking off.”

The money game

Beyond the Big Tech companies, a legion of start-ups are trying to find ways to make money with “generative” AI tech like image generators and chatbots. They include trying to replace customer service agents, writing advertising copy, summarizing doctors’ notes and even trying to detect deepfake AI images made by other AI tools. By replacing workers or helping employees become more productive, they hope to sell subscriptions to their AI tools.



Many computer programmers say they already use chatbots to help them write routine code. Usage across the rest of the workforce is also slowly increasing, according to Pew Research Center. Around 23 percent of U.S. adults said they’d used ChatGPT at work in February 2024, compared with 18 percent in July 2023, the research organization found.

“We’re at the very, very beginning,” said John Yue, founder of Inference.AI, a start-up that helps other tech companies find the computer chips they need to train AI programs. AI will work its way into every single industry, but it might take at least three to five years before people really see those changes in their own lives, he said. “We have to take a longer look.”

There are big roadblocks that could slow down the industry, too. Governments have also bought into AI hype, and politicians in the U.S. and abroad are busy debating how to regulate the tech. In the U.S., smaller AI companies have expressed worries that AI leaders like Google and OpenAI will lobby the government to make it harder for new entrants to compete.



In Europe, final details of the E.U.’s AI Act are being hammered out, and they promise to be more restrictive than companies are used to. One of the biggest concerns that Golshan, the AI data start-up CEO, hears from business clients is that new AI laws will render their investments a waste in the future. A battery of lawsuits have also been launched against OpenAI and other AI companies for using people’s work and data to train their AI without payment or permission.

Though the tech continues to improve, there are still glaring problems with generative AI. Figuring out how to make sure models that are supposed to be reliable don’t make up false information has vexed researchers. At Google’s big cloud computing conference in early April, the company offered a new solution to the problem: customers using its tech to train AI models could now let their bots fact-check themselves by simply looking things up on Google Search.

Some claims about AI’s near-magic ability to do human-level tasks have also been called into question. A new paper from researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Adobe, the Allen Institute for AI and Princeton showed that AI models routinely made factual mistakes and errors of omission when asked to summarize long documents. Another recent paper suggested that a claim that AI was better than the vast majority of humans at writing legal bar exams was exaggerated.



The big improvement in AI tech showcased by ChatGPT that kicked off the boom came from OpenAI feeding trillions of sentences from the open internet into an AI algorithm. Subsequent AIs from Google, OpenAI and Anthropic have added even more data from the web, increasing capabilities further. Seeing those improvements, some famous AI researchers moved up their predictions for when they think AI would surpass human-level intelligence. But AI companies are running out of data to train their models on, raising the question of whether the steady improvement in AI capability will plateau.

Training bigger and better AI models has another crucial ingredient — electricity to power the warehouses of computer chips crunching all that data. The AI boom has already kicked off a wave of new data center construction, but it’s unclear whether the United States will be able to generate enough electricity to run them. AI, coupled with a surge in new manufacturing facilities, is pushing up predictions for how much electricity will be needed over the next five years, said Mike Hall, CEO of renewable energy management software company Anza, and a 20-year veteran of the solar power industry.

“People are starting to talk about a crisis, are we going to have enough power?” Hall said.



Ethan Mollick, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies AI and business, said company executives are seeing the benefits of AI to their businesses in early experiments and tests, and are now trying to work out how to work it into their organizations more broadly.

Some of them are concerned that their AI tools might be made obsolete by new tech released in the future, making them hesitant to invest a lot of money right now, he said. OpenAI is set to unveil its latest AI model in the coming months, potentially offering a whole new set of capabilities, Mollick said.", last june inflection ai was riding high the artificial

91," — Google on Wednesday said it is providing artificial intelligence tools to help the National Guard analyze images of disaster areas so it can respond to them faster and more effectively. Bellwether, a new group inside “X,” the innovation lab that is part of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has developed tech that can ingest photos taken at an angle by airplanes, compare them with satellite imagery and maps, and automatically identify locations, roads, buildings and other important infrastructure. Bellwether has been testing the tech with the National Guard, which will deploy it in time for the summer wildfire season, said Nirav Patel, a program manager with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a Pentagon unit that helps the military integrate commercial technology and that helped organize the partnership.

Up until now, the National Guard — which coordinates the military’s response to tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires inside the United States and its territories — has had to rely on human analysts poring over aerial photos to figure out specifically which areas, buildings and infrastructure have been damaged after a disaster before being able to direct the right resources to the right places.



What used to take hours or days now takes just seconds, said Patel. He said he expects the tech to only become more important. “As climate change is impacting different parts of the Earth’s surface, the [Defense Department] is being pulled in,” Patel said. “We unfortunately only see that increasing.”

The collaboration between Bellwether and the National Guard shows how Silicon Valley is working more closely with the Defense Department. Though military funding and the space program were integral to getting Silicon Valley up and running in the 1950s and 1960s, few tech founders in recent decades have built companies with the goal of serving the military. The DIU was set up in 2015 to try to close that gap and find a way to cut through bureaucratic procurement processes and get the tech industry to work more closely with the Defense Department.

More recently, a new wave of Silicon Valley tech companies, including drone maker Anduril and AI company Shield AI, have begun building tech specifically for the military, casting themselves as patriots aiming to arm the U.S. military to retain its dominance through the 21st century. Venture-capital funding for defense tech start-ups is growing.



Google has a complicated history with the U.S. military. In 2018, the company walked away from a contract to build AI image-recognition tools for the Pentagon after employees protested the deal. But since then, it has steadily returned to military work and was one of four companies awarded a massive $9 billion contract to build cloud services for the Defense Department.", google on wednesday said it is providing artificial intelligence tools to help the national guard analyze images of disaster areas so it can respond to them faster and more effectively bellwether a new group inside x the innovation lab that is part of google s parent company alphabet has developed tech that can ingest photos taken at an angle by airplanes compare them with satellite imagery and maps and automatically identify locations roads buildings and other important infrastructure bellwether has been testing the tech with the national guard which will deploy it in time for the summer wildfire season said nirav patel a program manager with the defense innovation unit diu a pentagon unit that helps the military integrate commercial technology and that helped organize the partnership up until now the national guard which coordinates the military s response to tornadoes floods earthquakes and wildfires inside the united states and its territories has had to rely on human analysts poring over aerial photos to figure out specifically which areas buildings and infrastructure have been damaged after a disaster before being able to direct the right resources to the right places what used to take hours or days now takes just seconds said patel he said he expects the tech to only become more important as climate change is impacting different parts of the earth s surface the defense department is being pulled in patel said we unfortunately only see that increasing the collaboration between bellwether and the national guard shows how silicon valley is working more closely with the defense department though military funding and the space program were integral to getting silicon valley up and running in the s and s few tech founders in recent decades have built companies with the goal of serving the military the diu was set up in to try to close that gap and find a way to cut through bureaucratic procurement processes and get the tech industry to work more closely with the defense department more recently a new wave of silicon valley tech companies including drone maker anduril and ai company shield ai have begun building tech specifically for the military casting themselves as patriots aiming to arm the u s military to retain its dominance through the st century venture capital funding for defense tech start ups is growing google has a complicated history with the u s military in the company walked away from a contract to build ai image recognition tools for the pentagon after employees protested the deal but since then it has steadily returned to military work and was one of four companies awarded a massive billion contract to build cloud services for the defense department ,The Washington Post,Technology
92," — Less than two weeks after rolling back one of Amazon’s most ambitious artificial intelligence projects — a cashierless checkout technology called Just Walk Out — CEO Andy Jassy expressed confidence that the future of the company’s biggest breakthroughs for customers will come from generative AI. While Amazon has widely been viewed by consumers and the market as falling behind on AI, Jassy said in an annual shareholder letter published Thursday that he is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” or Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing business that many of the world’s digital businesses already rely on to run.

In the letter, Jassy laid out the company’s strategy on generative AI, describing how it is focused less on building consumer-facing applications to compete directly with popular tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT than on building the underlying “foundational” AI models and selling them to enterprise customers, which Jassy said already include Delta Air Lines, Siemens and Pfizer.



When ChatGPT came out a year and a half ago, it kicked off an arms race between Big Tech companies and a wave of new start-ups to build the best AI technology and figure out ways to make money from it. Billions of dollars have been spent, and Google, OpenAI and others such as Anthropic AI have released increasingly capable AI bots. But companies are struggling to find the right way to integrate them into their existing products, and for now, most consumers have yet to begin spending real money on the AI tools that have already been made available.

Amazon, for its part, has spent billions on generative AI. It recently invested an additional $2.75 billion, bringing its total investment to $4 billion in start-up Anthropic, giving it a minority stake. As part of the deal, Anthropic will run on Amazon Web Services, and Amazon will be able to offer its enterprise customers access to Anthropic’s Claude, one of the leading generative AI models.

The company added AI expert Andrew Ng, a highly respected AI pioneer and the former chief scientist at Chinese internet company Baidu, to its board as of Thursday. It has also committed billions of dollars to development of the data centers needed to power the growth of artificial intelligence technology.



But while Amazon is clearly seeking a path toward dominating the AI space, it has struggled so far to create consumer-facing products that resonate with customers. Earlier this year, it launched Rufus, a shopping assistant that failed to meaningfully improve on the existing search-based shopping experience. It has also stalled on development of a “smarter and more conversational” Alexa assistant, which it announced in September but has yet to release to customers.

While Amazon’s stock price has risen 25 percent so far this year, the company has yet to fully recover from its pandemic overspending. After laying off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2024, it continued to cut jobs last week, eliminating hundreds of positions in AWS that focused on the cashierless checkout program Just Walk Out that it nixed from Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

93,"Women are more likely to suffer from insomnia and say they have lower sleep quality. Men are more likely to have sleep apnea. Women’s circadian rhythms run earlier than men, and such disruptions have been associated with worse health outcomes. Men tend to overeat, and male shift workers have a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes, when sleep deprived.

These and other major sleep differences are highlighted in a new review of ongoing research into sleep and gender and have implications for how women and men could be treated for sleep-related disorders. The review by researchers at the University of Southampton, Stanford University and Harvard University is published in Sleep Medicine Reviews.

“Depending on your gender, should you get a different kind of treatment or a different kind of medication or a different dosage of medication, for example,” said Renske Lok, a postdoctoral scholar in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who led the review.



An estimated 50 million to 70 million Americans have chronic or ongoing sleep disorders, according to the National Institutes of Health. And 1 in 3 adults in the United States experience sleep deprivation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Women say they have lower sleep quality

The review found that women are more prone than men to lower sleep quality, which is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders.

The quality of women’s sleep in terms of the amount of deep sleep and the time they’re sleeping, as measured by brain activity, is good. But women complain far more than men about insomnia, the researchers found.

“Women maybe are a bit more open about … psychological consequences and the fact that they have bad sleep, whereas men are more inclined to keep it to themselves,” Lok said.



A study in 2021, not included in the review, suggested a different reason. Researchers at Lausanne University Hospital examined the sleep patterns of women to try to understand why they complained of waking up throughout the night when the sleep metrics showed they’d had a good night’s sleep.

Researchers glued 256 electroencephalographic or EEG electrodes to the scalp and face to get a deeper read on brain activity during sleep. They then woke the women at different times of night and asked them if they felt they were asleep or awake.

They found that the women who felt they had been awake frequently during the night, even though they appeared to have been asleep, were experiencing a high-frequency almost wake-like brain activity in a small part of their brain, while the other 95 percent of their brain was resting. This activity is not detected in standard sleep studies where only a handful of electrodes are used.



“Now we know that we understand what they’re feeling, because we see that in this small part of the brain, they still have some activity that makes them aware of being here, even though 95 percent of the brain is resting,” said Raphael Heinzer, director of the Center for Investigation and Research on Sleep at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland. “We never make fun of our patients, but we didn’t believe them.”

Women have an earlier circadian rhythm

Sleep disorders such as insomnia in women may also be because their circadian rhythm tends to run faster and begin a bit earlier in the day than that of men. A woman’s cycle is 24.09 hours, plus or minus 0.2 hours, while a man’s cycle is 24.19 hours, plus or minus 0.2 hours.

While the discrepancy may seem small, the cumulative effect over days, weeks or months could lead to a misalignment between the internal clock and external cues such as light and darkness, which may cause sleep disruptions.



The earlier cycle for women corresponds with an earlier timing in the secretion of melatonin and cortisol, researchers said. Melatonin is a natural hormone that signals to our bodies that it is time to sleep.

This finding relates to what earlier studies have found, said Christian Cajochen, head of the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel, who was not involved with the review. For instance, circadian rhythm differences — associated with hormones secreted during puberty — may explain sleep differences among younger men and women.

After they get their period, girls start going to sleep a cumulative 20 minutes later every year until they hit their early 20s, right about when puberty is ending.

Males experience a similar phenomenon in their teens, but it doesn’t end until their late 20s, said Cajochen, whose research includes age-related changes in the circadian regulation of sleep.



When children are sleeping and waking up “later, later, later, later, and then there is this tipping point, that’s the end of puberty. And this occurs later in men than in women,” Cajochen said. “When you see in your kids that they’re starting to get earlier again, so there is hope that puberty is over.”

Men’s risk of sleep apnea and Type 2 diabetes

The review found that men, because of the way their upper airway is constructed, are three times more likely to develop sleep apnea, making them more susceptible to health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

Also, men tend to overeat more than women when they are sleep deprived, the review found. And among shift workers, who are considered to be sleep deprived because of their unusual schedules and thus are out of alignment with their natural circadian rhythm, both men and women have a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes, but the risk was much higher in men, the researchers noted.

Gender differences are important

With such profound health implications, there is a need for better understanding about the gender differences in sleep and circadian biology, researchers said. And yet historically, biomedical research on sleep didn’t even include women, because it was thought that hormonal events such as menstruation and menopause presented so many confounding variables as to render the research unhelpful, Lok said.



If women were included, researchers typically only used women who were at the same spot in their menstrual cycle, or those who were taking oral contraceptives because they suppress the normal ovarian cycle.

The prevailing opinion was that sleep patterns were basically gender neutral, Lok said. But new studies have shown distinct differences in sleep quality, duration and latency between men and women and that these discrepancies may be caused by differences in the genders’ circadian rhythms, and the physiological changes that accompany them, such as core body temperature and melatonin levels, she said.",women are more likely to suffer from insomnia and say they have lower sleep

94,"When her husband was undergoing cancer treatment, Cindy Perez of Southwest Ranches, Fla., learned about a new blood test that could help find early cancers. The 50-year-old said she felt fine, but her husband urged her to take the test anyway.

To her surprise, the blood test — called Galleri — came back positive. Scans revealed a small tumor in her groin and a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, a rare but aggressive form of cancer. She was treated and now, two years later, she’s in remission. “For me, the test was a miracle,” she said. “A real big miracle.”

Many experts believe that such tests, which analyze substances in the blood that might indicate cancer, represent a remarkable new chapter in cancer detection. The tests may be especially useful finding “silent” cancers — such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer — which often don’t cause symptoms until the disease is advanced and more difficult to treat.

“It opens up a whole new world,” said Eric Klein, a scientist at the health-care company Grail who developed Galleri, a multi-cancer detection test. “It’s the unmet need we face in cancer.”

Finding early cancer ‘signals’

These new cancer detection blood tests — about 20 are in various stages of development — measure cancer “signals,” which are biological substances shed by cancers such as fragments of tumor DNA. Some can even identify the organ or tissue involved.

Technological and scientific advances in recent years, including discoveries in tumor biology, machine-learning tools and the ability to recognize circulating DNA and other substances in the blood, have made these new tests possible, experts said.

Some tests focus on one cancer, such as Guardant Health’s Shield test, which looks for colorectal cancer. Others screen for multiple cancers, including Grail’s Galleri and Exact Sciences’ Cancerguard, whose forerunner CancerSeek was developed and studied by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center.

Delfi’s FirstLook lung cancer test identifies patterns of DNA fragments in the blood that have been shed by dying cells unique to lung cancer and uses machine learning to distinguish those who probably have lung cancer from those who don’t, according to Peter Bach, Delfi’s chief medical officer.

“There are certain cancers where we know for sure that finding them early will save a lot of lives, and lung cancer is the biggest cancer problem we have today,” Bach said.

The tests don’t diagnose cancer — a positive result will probably lead to additional imaging tests or biopsies. Experts say the tests aren’t yet ready to replace standard-of-care screening tests such as colonoscopy, mammography or Pap smear but are meant to complement them.

One study of Galleri, for example, found the test predicted the cancer location with 88 percent accuracy. A study of the Delfi lung cancer test reported more than 90 percent accuracy, and a study of Guardant Health’s Shield showed an 83 percent accuracy in identifying patients with colon cancer.

While these findings are promising, experts warned of drawbacks. So far, there’s no evidence that finding cancer via a blood test translates to longer survival and fewer deaths, or even a cure, experts said.

“People want to believe there is one test that can pick up all the different kinds of cancers, and if it’s negative, they can go on their way,” said Lori Minasian, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute’s division of cancer prevention. “But it’s not that simple.”

Elusive targets for early detection

Several experts pointed out that multi-cancer detection tests don’t find every cancer at its earliest stage, in part because certain cancers spread quickly.

“It depends on the cancer,” said William Grady, medical director of the gastrointestinal cancer prevention program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle and one of the scientists who studied Guardant’s colon cancer test.

For example, he said, brain cancer frequently is an elusive target for early detection. “These tests are not effective for brain cancer because brain cancer spreads rapidly, even when early and very small, so it is not often curable even at an early stage,” he said.

Much remains unclear about how and when various cancers secrete the telltale substances detected by the new blood tests, and whether these markers show up early or often enough to make a difference in life expectancy.

Still, some patients who took the Galleri test are convinced it saved their lives.

In 2022, after Valerie Caro’s positive Galleri test, an MRI found “an angry gallbladder” that needed to come out, she said. Caro, 56, a real estate broker from Flagstaff, Ariz., was asymptomatic, but a small malignant tumor was among the gallstones. After treatment, she said she is now cancer-free.

“I don’t like to think about what would have happened if this had been discovered later,” she said.

Some employers now offer the tests

The Food and Drug Administration has not cleared any of the tests for final approval, but they are available as “lab-based” tests under federal regulations that permit their use in certain settings. The tests are not covered by Medicare or other insurance.

Nevertheless, some medical practices and employers now provide them. Any patient with a doctor’s prescription can get a Galleri test, which costs $949. Princeton University has been offering Galleri to eligible employees for free in a pilot program. Guardant’s colon cancer test, which costs $895, is also available, though not all doctors have access to it yet, the company said.

Later this year, Exact Sciences plans to make its test available on a limited basis, said Tom Beer, the company’s chief medical officer for multi-cancer early detection.

Susan Johns, 75, a retired Medicare counselor from Hegins, Pa., took a test as part of a CancerSeek study in 2018. After a positive test, scans revealed leiomyosarcoma in her uterus. After a hysterectomy, doctors believed they got it all, she said.

“I don’t know how aggressive it would have been,” she said. “But I have one grandchild and I was able to see him graduate from high school. I’m looking forward to his college graduation — and later to my great-grandkids.”

Not a replacement for traditional cancer screening

Studies show the rates of false positive and negatives are low among the new cancer blood tests. As with conventional screening, one concern is that a false positive could prompt anxiety and more invasive and costly tests, while a false negative could result in a misguided sense of security and lead patients to forgo proven conventional screening, experts say.

For instance, a blood test may not be as reliable as a colonoscopy at finding precancerous polyps or early cancers, in part because early cancers may shed less DNA. Grady, the Fred Hutchinson researcher, said that in studies, the Guardant test detected just 13 percent of people with advanced polyps, 71 percent of Stage 1 cancers and 100 percent of Stage 2 and 3 cancers.

But for patients who resist conventional screenings, the tests may be useful. Dennis Barnes, 55, a pharmaceutical compliance lawyer from Raleigh, N.C., was reluctant to go through the unpleasant bowel-cleaning preparation needed for a screening colonoscopy.

Instead, he took Guardant Health’s colon cancer blood test two years ago, which, to his relief, was negative. He’s being tested again this month. “I knew being an African American man made my risk higher, but the thought of a colonoscopy was not very appealing,” he said. When his doctor mentioned the blood test, “I jumped at it,” he said.

Finding out if the blood tests save lives

The National Cancer Institute recently announced the creation of the Cancer Screening Research Network, a clinical trials network of nine hubs coordinated by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. The goal is to design and ultimately sponsor a clinical trial to evaluate the benefits and risks of the new blood tests and to find out if using them reduces deaths, Minasian said.

Later this year, the network will launch a pilot study with 24,000 participants in advance of a potential larger randomized controlled trial. “We do see these tests as promising,” Minasian said. “The challenge now is to better understand the technology and harness it in a way that we know saves lives.”

The endpoint of such a trial “should be whether people who have taken the test survive longer,” said N. Jewel Samadder, co-director of precision oncology at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Phoenix, who has been a consultant for Caris Life Sciences, which is also designing a multi-cancer blood test. “It means nothing if these tests don’t lead to better survival.”

The tests probably are several years away from widespread use because so many questions remain unanswered, such as whether use of the tests should be based on age, risk factors or family history. It’s also unclear how frequently people should take the blood tests.

“Will we see these as part of a routine physical exam? We are not there yet, not at all,” Samadder said. “Will we get there? That is the hope.”

Jonathan, 69, of San Diego readily agreed three years ago to his doctor’s suggestion that he take the Grail blood test. His annual checkup — routine lab work and physical — had been normal, so he was surprised when the test came back positive. (He asked that his full name not be used to protect his medical privacy.)

After further checks, doctors found cancer in a lymph node under his right armpit, a form of Hodgkin lymphoma. After radiation and chemotherapy, he currently is cancer-free. If he hadn’t taken the blood test, “where would I be now?” he said. “Who knows? But it wouldn’t have gone away.”",when her husband was undergoing cancer treatment cindy perez of southwest ranches fla learned about a new blood test that could help find early cancers the year old

95,"But you don’t have to don spandex and schedule 30 minutes of exercise a day to meet your fitness goals. Fitness can happen throughout your day in surprisingly simple ways.

In fact, gym rats who dutifully exercise every day for 30 minutes only to spend the rest of the day in front of a computer aren’t doing themselves any favors. Studies show that if you exercise but also sit for the rest of the day, it’s almost as if you haven’t worked out at all. So if you have adopted a morning workout routine — keep it up. But make sure you’re engaging in small bursts of movement throughout your day.



Here are some tips for making daily exercise a little easier:

Pick up the pace: Hurrying through chores and moving with gusto just a few times a day is linked to a 40 percent lower risk of premature death in adults. Adding a little intensity to our lives pays big dividends for our health, without requiring extra equipment, instruction, gym memberships or time, writes our Your Move columnist Gretchen Reynolds. “Hurry to the bus stop. Rush up the stairs. Play tag with your kids. Romp with the dog. Vacuum the living room with a little extra zing,” she advises.

Just walk (but forget 10,000 steps): The latest science suggests fewer daily steps may be the sweet spot for many of us, depending on our age, fitness and health goals. In a major review of step research on almost 50,000 adults, researchers found that the optimal number of daily steps is less than 10,000 for many people. In general, the pooled data showed that for men and women younger than age 60, the greatest relative reductions in the risk of dying prematurely begin with 8,000 steps a day. For people older than age 60, the threshold was a little lower. For them, the sweet spot in terms of reduced mortality risk came at between 6,000 and 8,000 steps a day.

Try 2-minute bursts of exercise: Scientists call these short bursts of movement “exercise snacks.” Take a 20-second jaunt up and down the stairs at work. Do some jumping jacks or chair squats at your desk. Make a brisk lap around your office several times a day. In one study, healthy college students rapidly climbed and descended three flights of steps, three times a day — in the morning, at lunchtime and again in late afternoon — almost every day for six weeks. They did not otherwise work out. But after six weeks, they had gained significant amounts of aerobic fitness and leg strength.

When her husband was undergoing cancer treatment, Cindy Perez of Southwest Ranches, Fla., learned about a new blood test that could help find early cancers. The 50-year-old said she felt fine, but her husband urged her to take the test anyway.

To her surprise, the blood test — called Galleri — came back positive. Scans revealed a small tumor in her groin and a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, a rare but aggressive form of cancer. She was treated, and now, two years later, she’s in remission. “For me, the test was a miracle,” she said. “A real big miracle.”

Many experts believe that such tests, which analyze substances in the blood that might indicate cancer, represent a remarkable new chapter in cancer detection. These new cancer-detection blood tests — about 20 are in various stages of development — measure cancer “signals,” which are biological substances shed by cancers such as fragments of tumor DNA.



Some can even identify the organ or tissue involved. The tests may be especially useful in finding “silent” cancers — such as pancreatic or ovarian cancer — which often don’t cause symptoms until the disease is advanced and more difficult to treat.

“It opens up a whole new world,” said Eric Klein, a scientist at the health-care company Grail who developed Galleri, a multi-cancer detection test. “It’s the unmet need we face in cancer.”

More young people are getting cancer. Can I lower my risk?

I know someone who was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She’s in her 40s and totally healthy. Why do people like her get cancer?

Cancer rates among people younger than 50 — called early-onset cancer — have been on the rise worldwide since 1990. Men and women in their 40s represent the largest portion of those diagnoses.



While early-onset cancer rates are rising for many kinds of cancers — including breast, uterine, colorectal and prostate — they’re still relatively infrequent. In 2019, early-onset colorectal cancer occurred at a rate of 5.7 per 100,000 people (up from 3.5 in 1990), and breast cancer occurred at a rate or 13.7 per 100,000 people (up from 9.6 in 1990) worldwide.

This is why asking family members about their health history is crucial — it will affect when your physician recommends you get your first mammography or colonoscopy, and whether you may need more genetic testing. About a quarter of patients with early-onset colorectal cancer, for instance, have a family history that would have warranted screening earlier than age 45 — a missed opportunity to catch or even prevent those cancers early.

96,"Now & Then is an occasional series that delves into the cyclical nature of trends. The very first thing Betsey Johnson designed had a bow on it. It was 1964, and Johnson was a 22-year-old Mademoiselle editor. She had started making her own clothes as an art student, and decided to whip up a few sexy low-cut knit sweaters to sell around the office for extra cash.

“But the secret was: I put a quarter-inch velvet ribbon around the neckline and a tiny bow,” Johnson, now 81, recalls. They were so popular that she had to quit her day job.



“I have three checks in purple ink from [actress] Kim Novak,” Johnson says. “She loved this bow sweater.”

Johnson has never stopped putting bows on, well, everything: choker necklaces made of pantyhose in the 1960s, strapless party dresses in the ’80s, even grunge-era minis in the ’90s. “They’re timeless,” she says. So, she’s amused to hear that the bow is having a moment, with young designers such as Sandy Liang, Simone Rocha and Tanner Fletcher adding the adornment to pantsuits, purses, barrettes and more.

Add to that list Nell Diamond, the 35-year-old founder of Hill House Home, famous for its romantic “nap dresses” and hair ribbons. She launched Hill House in 2016 and takes inspiration from British school uniforms, Pre-Raphaelite art and Johnson herself. (She has a few of her vintage 1990s dresses.) The two recently connected over Zoom to discuss all things bows.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When did you first wear a bow?

Betsey Johnson: I think I was born with a bow! All the little girls in my classic Connecticut little cornball hometown wore bows. But the pair of bows that I wore practically every day were the bows in my tap-dancing shoes. They were the old-fashioned kind, with the two grommets and the holes that you thread your big ribbon through.

Nell Diamond: I would say the same: I’ve been in a bow since birth. I grew up mostly in London, and bows were a very big part of the quintessential English toddler look. And I loved them from a very early age. Also, I have a lot of hair, and so I liked to adorn my hair in many ways. I liked headbands. I liked bows. I liked little flowers. I couldn’t get enough.

But I had some dark eras in my life. Whenever I’ve turned away from bows, things were not going well for me. And if I put a bow back on, things would start suddenly going well again.

For more Style stories, click here End of carousel Johnson: That makes sense. Diamond: Right after college, I worked in finance. [Johnson gasps in horror.] Diamond: One of the hardest things for me was getting dressed to go into the office. I felt like I was putting on a costume every day, because I had to wear these dull colors. I couldn’t wear my cat-eye makeup. I wasn’t supposed to wear dark nail polish, jewelry or my bows. And I think that was a huge reason I left, and I went to business school and I started this company because I felt so unable to do the basic things I needed to do in a day when I felt like I was in somebody else’s skin. [Johnson nods vigorously.] I think there’s this idea that bows are juvenile, because they are so associated with femininity and girlhood. Diamond: I was a child in the ’90s, and there was this idea that feminism and archetypal femininity aren’t paired together, when in fact they’re the most beautiful pairing in the world. I remember having a teacher tell me — yell at me — for wearing glitter eye shadow and tell me no one will ever take me seriously.

But my parents were amazing and told me my actions are what define me — and not what I wear. My mom always said, “You have to let your freak flag fly and be who you are.” Now, as CEO of a company and having raised all these rounds of venture capital and going into these board meetings, I purposely go the most extra I can in those circumstances.

Johnson: I get that. Take the ’90s and go backward to the ’40s, and it was the same thing. But with all my dancing and costumes and makeup, what I really wanted to be was a Rockette, but I was too short!

But to me, bows were very sexy, very glamorous. Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall. Lingerie. My dance teacher was the most amazing costume designer, and she always believed bows should work. And that was a design element that I always believed in. I never put a fake bow. Bows had to always work, because that’s the beauty of a bow.

Diamond: I totally agree that bows should be functional! I think that that’s actually their origin: It’s a very functional thing to tie something, and then you make it pretty [by finishing it off with a bow]. You need the [string or ribbon] for a reason, but that doesn’t mean it can’t look amazing at the same time.

Do you see something subversive about bows?

Johnson: One of my favorite dresses I designed with bows was very punk. It was black and had all these tiny bows, beautifully tied, like all over the place. It was like a cactus. Janis Joplin wore bows and ribbons in her hair. It’s rock-and-roll.

Diamond: I love looking at NCAA athletes who wear bows in their hair when they’re competing. I love seeing Olympic skiers with little bows on each pigtail. I love people who challenge our expectations, and I think that there’s a really beautiful thing about doing that with bows.

Johnson: Bows can be completely timeless and made out of anything, from plastic to net to tulle. I love tulle bows — wispy, thin tulle or stiff tulle. It’s fun to experiment with what can actually make a bow.

Diamond: Have you seen the trend that’s going around that’s like people putting bows on random things? Like in our office, we put bows on Diet Coke cans sometimes.

Johnson: Oh my gosh!

Diamond: Or tie one on the fridge handle or on a lamp. I love this idea of, “Why not?” Why not just pop a bow on a random thing? Make your Diet Coke beautiful.

Johnson: That’s brilliant. I think we need bows right now — especially in these times we’re living in. People want uplifting. They want fun. They want playfulness. We need more buttons and bows and beads.

Maybe that’s why bows are so resonant now.

Johnson: I don’t know, but I’m happy about it. I love bows.",now then is an occasional series that delves into the cyclical nature of trends the very first thing betsey johnson designed had a bow on it it was and johnson was a year old

97,"Despite controversies, furs and fur-like materials are making their way down the runways again

The premise at the heart of fashion is that something that looked hideously out of date just a moment ago is suddenly the only thing that looks correct. Still, a few ideas seem destined never to make their return: fashion shows that appropriate garments from other cultures, heroin chic, the bizarre fad in the 1910s for the hobble skirt that made it nearly impossible for the wearer to walk.

You would think that fur might be included on that list, given that it has inspired multiple protests on the runway from organizations such as PETA, even leading anti-fur activists to throw a tofu pie at Vogue editor Anna Wintour for sporting it.

Yet the controversial material seems to be making a comeback. It may no longer be the faux pas it recently was — or, shall we say, fur pas.



Michael Kors, Prada, Simone Rocha, Miu Miu and Saint Laurent, to name a few, all included fur or a fur-like material in their latest collections.

Some designers have found workarounds that give a fur look without the use of traditional animal fur. At Prada, for example, patches on cocktail dresses that appeared to be caramel mink or fox were in fact shearling, which is considered more ethical because it’s a byproduct of the meat industry. Miuccia Prada’s Miu Miu collection also included faux fur in the form of chubby coats that referenced the mid-century style of elegant Milanese women, which is celebrated by Instagram accounts like @sciuraglam.

For more Style stories, click here End of carousel Mrs. Prada’s furs struck right at the tension between shoppers’ desires and designers’ ability to deliver on them. When asked backstage whether the Miu Miu fur was real, she grinned. “Noooo!” she said, laughing. “Shearling, shearling, shearling!” But it looked like “the old family fur coat,” said a reporter. “Yes — that was the intention.” Saint Laurent, whose creative director, Anthony Vaccarello, has designed without fur since Kering announced the ban in September 2021, looked to “a collection of Mr. Saint Laurent’s, but I didn’t want to do in fur, because we don’t do fur anymore,” he said backstage. Instead, he used feathers gathered together to create a puffy, fluffy jacket. Demna, whose label, Balenciaga, is also under the Kering umbrella, has gotten especially creative in his approach to creating fur-like looks and textures, using silk and feathers, and even hand-painting linen to look like fur. Why fur now?

More immediately, designers are realizing that, although faux fur may solve the problem of animal cruelty, it comes with its own issues. Jane Francis, an assistant professor of fashion at the Parsons School of Design who describes herself as an advocate for sustainability, said that “imitation or faux fur is problematic in a different way. It’s non-biodegradable. It’s fundamentally made from plastic.” Some designers, such as Stella McCartney, are investing in research for plant-based faux furs, “but we are not at that stage yet,” Francis said, so some designers see real fur as the more ethical alternative.

Yves Salomon, the Paris-based furrier who has made fur coats for decades and supplies several fashion houses with furs, said in a recent interview that our recurring attraction to fur “is very simple: It’s beautiful. When you are wearing a fur coat, you feel different. And you have an emotion,” he said. “A fur coat, first of all, is glamorous. It makes men and women more open, more beautiful somehow.” He compares the emotional reaction with that inspired by jewelry.

Francis echoed that sentiment: “It’s a really complex and difficult conversation” to discuss fur in fashion, she said. “Fashion brands are always striving for something beautiful, and seductive, and desirable. And natural fur absolutely has that, because it comes from an animal, and animals are fundamentally beautiful.”

After the “low point” of several fashion brands banning fur three or so years ago, Salomon began seeing more women on the streets of Paris in the beginning of 2023 wearing “extreme fur: coats to the knee, coats to the feet, foxes, huge fur coats,” he said. “And that was not really coming from us, honestly. That was coming from the young people with a lot of TikTok [followers].”

The “mob wife” aesthetic, celebrating the gleeful excess of mafia-adjacent style on TikTok, embraced furs as a touchstone of its look. And on TV, the much-discussed debut of Ryan Murphy’s “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans” in January revived an interest in mid-century styles like full skirts and cocktail hats — garments that are often accompanied by fur coats or stoles.

Salomon said that many younger consumers see real fur as the more sustainable alternative to faux fur, which is made of plastic and oil. “It is not a secret that fur is the most sustainable product of the whole fashion industry,” he said. “Because you can recycle fur, right? You can recut an old coat, you can buy a [new] coat and in five years, you can remake it. You can have a fur for life.”

He also said that brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior — which are part of LVMH, which has not instituted any kind of rules around fur — have seen a lot of success with the material, especially in menswear.

Salomon has spent the past several decades developing practices to ensure that his furs are sourced ethically. Every coat has a number that allows Salomon and the purchaser to trace the fur to the farm from which it came, some of which are run by Native communities in Canada, but most of which are in Europe and independently audited, “so we can be sure the animal welfare is respected.”

What that means, Salomon says, is “the animal is living in a proper space. It means that there’s no injuries, no illness, and that the food is correct, and the animal doesn’t suffer.” Salomon said that this is essential to the quality of his coats: “The condition of the fur is directly connected with the way the animal is treated.”



He pointed to the recent Bloomberg exposé about Loro Piana’s vicuña cashmere, which comes from a community whose workers are not paid a living wage, according to the report. “It’s very important to protect the Native communities which are [making a] living from fur,” he said, such as the Inuit of North America. Fur coats also require a kind of craftsmanship that Salomon hopes to shield from decline — a concern that many fashion leaders in France have about specialties such as lacemaking, leatherwork and even hand-sewing. “We feel that protecting craftsmanship is a key issue today. We feel that fur must be part of the fashion world. And we give all the possible assurance that it is done in a proper way, and we can prove it.”

Francis emphasized that “fur is 100 percent biodegradable. So, therefore, yes, in effect, it is completely sustainable and completely ethical.” But in the past 30 years, “awareness has been raised and animal cruelty and animal rights issues that are absolutely relevant and critical to this conversation.”

“I think if we can return to a slower, more sustainable and circular system of fur production, as it was historically before it became, I guess, commoditized,” she said, “I think that would be a better future if we were more mindful of our fur production and honoring the beauty of that material.”

Still, some younger designers see fur as fundamentally untouchable. In a collection shown in Paris, the millennial-aged designers of Vaquera, Patric DiCaprio and Bryn Taubensee, put gruesomely faux fur on wraps, gloves and jackets in a collection themed around the disgustingness of contemporary wealth. “We like a kind of gross fur, because fur is gross,” Taubensee said. “Fur is a classic symbol of wealth and fanciness, so it’s fun to subvert that a little bit and make it gross,” DiCaprio said.

“Especially real fur is like —” he continued.

“Disgusting,” finished Taubensee.

“The idea of cutting and sewing that — whew!” DiCaprio said.

“Cutting and sewing the faux fur is also disgusting,” Taubensee said. DiCaprio agreed. “It’s in your nose, in your bed at home, you’re hooking up with someone and you’re pulling faux fur out of their mouth. It’s a lot.”",despite controversies furs and fur like materials are making their way down the runways again the premise at the heart of fashion is that something that looked hideously out of date just

98,"It’s been a roller coaster time in fashion. Early last week, Dries Van Noten announced he is leaving the label he launched nearly 40 years ago. On Friday, Valentino’s creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, who had been at the brand for 25 years, announced he would depart. Van Noten said he was in the midst of finding his successor, but Valentino’s C-suite wasted little time. By Thursday morning, the Rome-based house already had a new leader: Alessandro Michele, who from 2015 to 2022 transformed Gucci from a staid luxury player to a global powerhouse of maximalist, pop-philosophy fashion. He left Gucci abruptly at the end of 2022, allegedly because he pushed back against the pressure to deliver ever-higher profits.

“It’s an incredible honour for me to be welcomed at Maison Valentino. I feel the immense joy and the huge responsibility to join a Maison de Couture that has the word ‘beauty’ carved on a collective story, made of distinctive elegance, refinement and extreme grace,” Michele said in the press release. “Today, I search for words to nominate the joy, to regard it, to really convey what I feel: the smiles that kick from the chest, the bliss of gratitude that lights up the eyes, that precious moment when necessity and beauty reach out and meet. Joy, though, is such a living thing that I’m afraid to hurt it if I dare to speak its name.”

Designers — or more accurately, their CEOs — are often playing musical chairs, but the shuffling of three high-profile designers in less than two weeks is whiplash-inducing.

At the same time, the way consumers acquire and learn about their goods is in major flux. Earlier this month, the British luxury e-commerce site Matchesfashion entered administration (the British equivalent of bankruptcy), and late last year, London-based Farfetch narrowly avoided a similar fate. Net-a-Porter, once heralded as the future of shopping, is actively seeking a buyer after a deal between its parent company, Richemont, and Farfetch fell apart last year.

In the meantime, Condé Nast, which publishes fashion mainstays, including Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, has been lurching through a round of layoffs, while i-D, considered the original indie bible of fashion, laid off much of its staff this week as new owner Karlie Kloss oversees a reinvention.



We are either in the midst of a monumental fashion shake-up — or rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

Julie Gilhart, the longtime fashion director at Barneys New York who works with emerging fashion talents at the Tomorrow Group, says that fashion always reflects dissatisfactions in the larger world. “The world seems so chaotic and no one has answers. We have so much technology that we’re not really good at managing it, or knowing where it’s going,” she continues. “But it doesn’t address our souls. There are a lot of people who are just not satisfied, so you have to mix it up, you have to change it, you have to do things differently.”

The Michele appointment is a case in point of how differently one piece of news might read. Many of the recent appointments have been homogenous choices; variations on a meme have circulated over the past half year emphasizing that many of the names who have joined brands like Alexander McQueen, Moschino and Gucci have been White men with brown hair. Responses to new faces outside the mold, like Chloé’s Chemena Kamali and Michele (who is a White man, and already a tested talent, although — he has long hair!), have shown just how hungry fashion observers are for change.



Michele represents the potential for aesthetic revolt, even if he doesn’t represent new blood, per se. “Alessandro’s dynamic and disruptive view of both the archive and the moment have been sorely missed these last few seasons,” Jeremy O. Harris, the playwright, actor and producer who regularly wore Michele’s Gucci, says. “Pierpaolo, one of the great innovators, could only be succeeded by someone as innovative as Ale. This is such a great day for people who love fashion.”

Actress Hari Nef, another Michele acolyte and close observer of fashion’s comings and goings, said that Michele’s return signals a move away from the laser focus quiet luxury. “Over the last few years, fashion has assumed a conservative pose: simultaneously self-effacing and grand. The condition at the center of ‘quiet luxury’ is ‘Look at me! Don’t look at me!’” she says. “Alessandro’s Gucci was too deeply considered to emerge as a hindsight foil to this ‘quiet’ wave, but there was an exuberance to it, a voraciousness and a gusto for being seen. Is that not what fashion is all about?”

The new role offers a more moderate challenge for Michele (though he will be making couture for the first time, the dream of practically every designer). Gucci, with revenue of about 10 billion euros, is the heavyweight in Kering’s portfolio, whereas Valentino reported more modest revenue of 1.42 billion euros in 2022. Under Piccioli, Valentino was known for its clean, jet set sportswear and for making couture relevant far beyond its tiny customer base, plus much-discussed celebrity ensembles like Florence Pugh in nipple-baring gowns. Michele may feel more pressure to move products, though he proved himself an accessories superstar at Gucci with his fur-lined slides and retro bags, and practically wrote the playbook for eccentric celebrity partnerships.

Kering may also be acknowledging that the world needs a bit more variety. In 2023, Kering acquired a 30 percent stake in Valentino, which was previously fully owned by the Qatari-based investment firm Mayhoola. That deal included an option for Kering to outright acquire Valentino by 2028. The wrench, or something like it: Kering also owns Gucci, which means that Michele is returning to the same company that, reportedly, chewed him up and spit him out.



Kering’s chair and CEO, François-Henri Pinault, said in a statement: “I am very happy that Alessandro has been appointed at the creative helm of Valentino and I am certain that with his creativity, culture and versatile talent, he will be able to interpret masterfully the unique heritage of this magnificent house and make it flourish. I can’t wait to see his passion, imagination and dedication at play in this new chapter for Valentino.”

Either the bad blood is over for the sake of increased profits (Women’s Wear Daily reported last week that Michele’s noncompete agreement with Gucci was said to expire this month), or Michele’s appeal is simply irresistible. Still, Kering is in financial hot water: This month, it reported its overall sales were down about 10 percent in the first quarter, with sales at its marquee brand Gucci, where a new designer, Sabato de Sarno, and its corporate team are attempting a major upscale turnaround, are down 20 percent.

The first collection from de Sarno only arrived in stores in February, Kering noted, but the perception is not good; its stock dropped 14 percent following the news. Michele could provide the new energy that Kering needs: His debut show, in Paris in the fall, is already the most anticipated of the season, at least according to Vogue’s announcement.

Phoebe Philo’s label, independently operated with a minority investment, continues on its own sui generis path: no fashion shows, no big ad campaigns in glossy magazines. Just a straightforward product with beautiful imagery, shown on women who may be unfamiliar — especially because many have decades on the average runway model — but are utterly unique.

Then there’s the possibility of Van Noten’s heir. Van Noten, who does everything with crisp humanity, is likely to take his time naming his successor, and will pick a trusted talent rather than a splashy name — Meryll Rogge, who once worked with Van Noten before founding her own label, as well as a print maven like Hillary Taymour, of Collina Strada, or a color savant like Christopher John Rogers, all seem like strong possibilities. Any of them would represent a changing of the guard and would bring a new jolt of much-needed youth to the staid halls of Paris design.



At LVMH, the top job at Givenchy remains open since Matthew Williams announced his departure late last year. It is also likely that Michael Burke, who earlier this year was appointed CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, may make or encourage greater change at brands under his stable, which includes Givenchy, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Loewe. Burke was previously CEO at Louis Vuitton, and was instrumental in bringing the late (and very boundary-pushing) Virgil Abloh to the label.

Fashion people, though, have a tendency to blow things out of proportion. What is mildly interesting so often becomes fascinating; what is mediocre is described as terrible. So what’s really going on here?

“The shift is upon us,” admits Nikki Ogunnaike, the editor of Marie Claire. Still, “Sometimes I wonder if we’re grasping! Valentino could have gone to a woman.” We should really think of all this change as “a baby step of disruption,” she says.



After all, the e-commerce news is not good. And even though a handful of retailers remain — independent boutiques that offer smaller and alternative labels, like Washington’s Relish, are thriving, as is Munich-based e-tailer Mytheresa — most clothes are so outrageously expensive that the whole enterprise feels increasingly irrelevant.

And Michele’s comeback may end up having more in common with Riccardo Tisci’s unstimulating tenure to Burberry after several rousing years at Givenchy (or Daniel Lee’s move to the brand just a year after he left Bottega Veneta under mysterious circumstances). Is it what fashion needs to pull itself out of this staid luxurious rut, or another example of the same few names getting the plum jobs?

Gilhart says that what keeps her optimistic is the amount of young designers “who are trying to create something more responsible, more sustainable or more ethical.”

99,"It took less than an hour and $10 in supplies for Shannon McClain to make her sash — a strip of white polyester fabric lined with pleated red and blue ribbons. And stamped boldly across the material in big block letters is a pledge of her allegiance: “BEYHIVE.” McClain, 34, has always loved to dress up. Since high school, she has worn costumes, collected unique items of clothing and crafted some of her own pieces. But as far as she can recall, she’d never draped a sash across her body before. Then she saw the cover art for Beyoncé's forthcoming album, “Cowboy Carter.”

In an image posted to her Instagram, the superstar sits atop a galloping white stallion as she dons full rodeo attire and a ruffled sash imprinted with the album title. In another photo, a sash is the only thing draping her body, bearing the words “act ii BEYINCÉ” — a message that fans and media outlets rushed to decode.

“They’re just so beautiful,” McClain said of the sashes. “I knew immediately I had to try to DIY those. … So I went downstairs and got out the sewing machine.”

It’s been nearly two years since Beyoncé’s Act I “Renaissance” album, which launched a world tour and sparked an explosion of sequined looks and mirror-coated cowboy hats among fans worldwide. Now with the promotional rollout for Beyoncé’s next solo album, out Friday, fans are anticipating that the sash could be the new motif for the Houston native’s country era and potential shows.



Some, like McClain, are hand-making their pieces. Others are flocking to Etsy sellers for custom sashes embroidered with their own personal statements — shimmers of a burgeoning fashion frenzy for a swath of fabric largely worn as decoration and marks of distinction at pageants, commencement ceremonies and bachelorette parties.

Allie Birge, 31, was anticipating an eventual demand for the accessory when she customized and ordered her “Cowboy Allie” sash from an Etsy seller last week — a piece she said she would wear to a future show or a rodeo. “I definitely wanted to have it before the rush comes in because a lot of the silver ‘Renaissance’ stuff just increased in price so drastically,” Birge said. “So I was basically just trying to get ahead of it.”

It’s not clear whether Beyoncé will embark on another world tour for “Cowboy Carter,” where sashes would likely abound. But at the very least, Jourdan Goode imagines they might wear their recently ordered “Cowboy Jour” sash at a Beyoncé-themed party. “Sashes aren’t really like a part of my style, but I’m always open to exploring new styles,” said Goode, 21.



“And Beyoncé has great influence because she’s one of my favorite artists,” they added.

As the star has shared in her recent album announcement, “Cowboy Carter” sets out to surprise, inform and inspire its listeners.

“Beyoncé seems ready to take us on another amazing journey, and I want to hear and understand more of that,” McClain said. “I think it’s really interesting that the disco cowboy hat was such a signifier of ‘Renaissance’ when we didn’t really understand why the cowboy hat [was important] yet. So I think there’s more to be uncovered here still.”

Many fans have already noted the visual consistency in the art for Acts I and II. Both covers feature minimal but striking portrayals of Beyoncé perched on a horse. And styling throughout the visuals — the fringe jackets, cowboy hats and boots — nod to the YeeHaw Agenda, an internet movement to reclaim Black cowboy culture through music and fashion.

But incorporating the sash in Act II makes more than a fashion statement. Fans suspect the “Cowboy Carter” sash on the main cover art isn’t just a catchy reference to Beyoncé’s married name, it’s also connected to the Carter family, known as “the first family of country music” and Amon G. Carter, who helped create the image of the Texas cowboy. Meanwhile, the “BEYINCÉ”-printed sash, which appears on a limited-edition album cover, initially puzzled some fans who assumed the spelling was a typo.



In wake of the confusion, comments made by Beyoncé’s mom Tina Knowles during a 2020 podcast interview resurfaced online. Appearing on an episode of Heather Thomson’s “In My Heart” podcast, Knowles explained that “Beyoncé” is her maiden name, but she and her brother Skip were the only two out of five siblings in her family to have that spelling on their birth certificates. Others read “Beyincé.”

Knowles said her mom once requested that the documents be corrected but was told, “be happy that you’re getting a birth certificate.” In imprinting Beyincé on “Cowboy Carter,” Beyoncé is reclaiming her family’s history using a banner that has long served as a political statement.

As early as the 16th century, sashes were included in military uniforms in Europe to distinguish high-ranking officers or to demonstrate affiliation to a specific political party or nation. World leaders and royal families wear them. And, famously, sashes became an iconic emblem of the suffrage movement in the early 20th century. Emblazoned with the words “Votes for Women,” sashes were worn by suffragists at rallies and parades.

In modern U.S. culture, the sash has acquired a more festive purpose. They are used at commencement ceremonies, in high school homecoming events and in beauty pageants. Over the years, they have also made their way to the fashion runway, often styled around the waist than diagonally across the body — from Yves Saint Laurent and Dior to Louis Vuitton and Diane von Furstenberg.



Jude Macasinag, a Filipino fashion designer based in Paris, created “The Pageant Sash Bar Jacket” for his most recent collection Haute Queer-ture. “With this piece specifically, I wanted to show the influence of pageantry [on] Filipinos and how it informs the things we do,” Macasinag said in an email to The Washington Post.

Ultimately, Macasinag said, the importance of the sash is in how it lends itself as a clear canvas for a message. “Be it the name of a country one represents or significant graphic imagery; the sash itself is semiotics made fashionable,” he said.

Beyoncé isn’t the only artist incorporating the statement-making sash. Olivia Rodrigo, who has often teased pageantry themes in her music visuals, recently dropped a line of sashes in her merch store adorned with phrases like “Miss read his texts” and “Miss focus on my career.”



“The internet has changed what we wear clothes for,” said McClain. “Clothing doesn’t just serve practical functions and it never has, but I think that line has become even fuzzier in the last few years. And so I think less and less about ‘Where am I going to wear this’ and more and more about ‘Do I want to wear this.’”

Going a step further to personalize her fashion is an idea that has always connected McClain to Beyoncé.

“Bringing that self-expression back out into daily life has been a message I think was emphasized by ‘Renaissance,’” she said, “and I’m just continuing that forward with making a sash.”",it took less
